This is Trigrams'n'Tags, the statistical part of speech tagger.

INSTALLATION:

The programs come in a compressed (gzip) archive file (tar) (zip-ed for
Windows), by default named tnt-VERSIONINFO.tar.gz for the Linux and
Solaris, tnt-VERSIONINFO.zip for windows. Move this file to a directory of
your choice. Here, a sub-directory `tnt' will be created, which contains
all the necessary files. Type

        gzip -dc tnt-VERSIONINFO.tar.gz | tar xvf -

or follow the instructions of your zip program (Windows).

This uncompresses the archive and extracts all files to the
installation directory.

Now, the installation directory contains four executables:

        tnt  tnt-diff  tnt-para  tnt-wc

as well as directories for the documentation and the language models.

Add the name of the installation directory (.../tnt) to the PATH environment
variable to use these four programs from any place in your directory hierarchy,
and set the environment variable TNT_MODELS to .../tnt/models (of course, `...'
needs to be replaced by the complete path name) so that can tnt find the
language model files.  That's it.
