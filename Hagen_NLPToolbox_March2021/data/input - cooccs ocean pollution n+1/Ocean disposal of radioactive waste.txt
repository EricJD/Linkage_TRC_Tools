At immediate vicinity of waste containers, elevated levels of radionuclide were found, but had not contaminated the surrounding area.===North-East Atlantic Ocean ===Dumping was undertaken by UK, Switzerland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Italy.IAEA had been studying since 1977. The report of 1996, by CRESP suggests measurable leakages of radioactive material, and, concluded that environmental impact is negligible.===North-East Pacific Ocean, North-West Atlantic Ocean dump sites of USA===These sites are monitored by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and US [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]. So far, no excess level of radionuclides was found in samples (sea water, sediments) collected in the area, except the sample taken at a location close to disposed packages that contained elevated levels of isotopes of [[caesium]] and [[plutonium]].===North-West Pacific Ocean dump sites of the Soviet Union, Japan, Russia, and Korea===The joint Japanese-Korean-Russian expedition (1994-95) concluded that contamination resulted mainly from global fallout. The USSR dumped waste in the Sea of Japan. Japan dumped waste south of the main island.== Policies ==The first conversations surrounding dumping radioactive waste into the ocean began in 1958 at the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference (UNCLOS).{{Cite journal |last1=Bewers |first1=J. M. |last2=Garrett |first2=C. J. R. |date=1987-04-01 |title=Analysis of the issues related to sea dumping of radioactive wastes |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0308-597X%2887%2990003-0 |journal=Marine Policy |language=en |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=105-124 |doi=10.1016/0308-597X(87)90003-0 |issn=0308-597X}} The conference resulted in an agreement that all states should actively try to prevent radioactive waste pollution in the sea and follow any international guidelines regarding the issue. The UNCLOS also instigated research into the issues radioactive waste dumping caused.However, by the late 1960s to early 1970s, millions of tons of waste were still being dumped into the ocean annually.{{Cite web |title=The Ocean Is Not a Dumping Ground Fifty Years of Regulating Ocean Dumping |url=https://www.iisd.org/articles/regulating-ocean-dumping |access-date=2022-04-22 |website=International Institute for Sustainable Development |language=en}} By this time, governments began to realize the severe impacts of marine pollution, which led to one of the first international policies regarding ocean dumping in 1972 - the London Convention. The London Conventionu2019s main goals were to effectively control sources of marine pollution and take the proper steps to prevent it from happening, mainly accomplishing this by banning specific substances from being dumped in the ocean.{{Cite web |title=Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter |url=https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/London-Convention-Protocol.aspx |access-date=2022-04-22 |website=www.imo.org}} The most recent version of the London Convention now bans all materials from marine dumping, except a thoroughly researched list of certain wastes. It also prohibits waste from being exported to other countries for disposal, as well as incinerating waste in the ocean. While smaller organizations like the Nuclear Energy Agency of the European Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have produced similar regulations, the London Convention remains the central international figure of radioactive waste policies.Although there are many existing regulations that ban ocean dumping, it is still a prevalent issue. Different countries enforce the ban on radioactive waste dumping on different levels, resulting in an inconsistent implementation of the agreed upon policies. Because of these discrepancies, it is hard to judge the effectiveness of international regulations like the London Convention.==See also==[[Horizontal drillhole disposal]][[Ocean floor disposal]] [[Deep borehole disposal]] [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] [[Grigory Pasko]] [[Nuclear fuel cycle]] [[Radioactive waste]] {{format link|Great Lakes Basin#Nuclear power plants}} [[Decommissioning of Russian nuclear-powered vessels]]==References=={{Reflist}}{{waste}}{{Nuclear Technology}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Ocean disposal of radioactive waste}}}]}}
