In October, he outlined the project in a [[TED (conference)|TED-talk]]. The initial design consisted of long, floating barriers fixed to the seabed, attached to a central platform shaped like a [[manta ray]] for stability. The barriers would direct the floating plastic to the central platform, which would remove the plastic from the water. Slat did not specify the dimensions of this system in the talk.{{Cite web|title=How the oceans can clean themselves: Boyan Slat at Delft |website=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-10-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROW9F-c0kIQ|access-date=2018-09-09|archive-date=2018-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908235828/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROW9F-c0kIQ|url-status=live}}=== 2014-2017: Initial prototypes ===In 2014, the design replaced the central platform with a tower detached from the floating barriers.

The system included a retention zone where material is held before it is removed from the water, with the nets' mesh size there was increased from 10 to 50 mm.

The structure acts as a [[Boom (containment)|containment boom]]. A permeable screen underneath the float catches subsurface debris. It incorporated an {{Convert|800|m|abbr=on}} barrier and added active propulsion to allow the system to operate at higher speed. Crewed boats tow the U-shaped barrier through the water at 1.5 knots. The ship can also be steered to areas with higher waste densities. In July 2022, the floating system reached the milestone of 100,000&nbsp;kg of plastic removed from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheOceanCleanup/status/1551599038402805761|title=Today we reached an exciting milestone: over 100,000kg of plastic removed from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch|website=twitter.com}}=== River system ===The Interceptor is a solar-powered, automated system designed to capture and extract waste. Along with an optimized water flow path, a barrier guides rubbish towards the opening of the Interceptor and onto the conveyor belt, which delivers waste to the shuttle. The shuttle deposits the waste equally into one of six bins according to sensors. When the bins are almost full, local operators are informed with an automated message. They then empty them and send the waste to local waste management facilities. The Interceptor project is similar to a smaller-scale local project called [[Mr. Trash Wheel]] developed in 2008 for Maryland's [[Baltimore Harbor|Baltimore harbor]].
