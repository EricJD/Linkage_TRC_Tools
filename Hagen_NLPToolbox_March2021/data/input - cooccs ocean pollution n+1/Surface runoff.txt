It occurs when excess [[rain]]water, [[stormwater]], [[meltwater]], or other sources, can no longer sufficiently rapidly infiltrate in the [[soil]]. This can occur when the [[soil]] is [[#Saturation excess overland flow|saturated]] by water to its full capacity, and the rain arrives [[#Infiltration excess overland flow|more quickly than the soil can absorb]] it. Surface runoff often occurs because [[impervious#Adjective|impervious]] areas (such as [[roof]]s and [[Road surface|pavement]]) do not allow water to soak into the ground. Furthermore, runoff can occur either through natural or human-made processes.{{Cite web|date=2011-01-21|title=runoff|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/runoff/|access-date=2021-02-19|website=National Geographic Society|language=en}}Surface runoff is a major component of the [[water cycle]].

This residual water moisture affects the soil's [[infiltration capacity]]. During the next rainfall event, the infiltration capacity will cause the soil to be saturated at a different rate. The higher the level of antecedent soil moisture, the more quickly the soil becomes saturated. Once the soil is saturated, runoff occurs. Therefore, surface runoff is a significantly factor in the controlling of soil moisture after medium and low intensity storms.{{Cite journal|last1=Castillo|first1=V.

This is called subsurface return flow or [[throughflow]].As it flows, the amount of runoff may be reduced in a number of possible ways: a small portion of it may [[evapotranspiration|evapotranspire]]; water may become temporarily stored in microtopographic depressions; and a portion of it may [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]] as it flows overland. Any remaining surface water eventually flows into a [[surface water|receiving water]] body such as a [[river]], [[lake]], [[estuary]] or [[ocean]].Nelson, R. (2004). ''The Water Cycle.'' Minneapolis: Lerner. {{ISBN|0-8225-4596-9}}==Human influence==[[Urbanization]] increases surface runoff by creating more [[impervious surface]]s such as [[pavement (roads)|pavement]] and buildings that do not allow [[percolation]] of the water down through the soil to the [[aquifer]]. It is instead forced directly into streams or [[storm drain|storm water runoff drains]], where [[erosion]] and [[siltation]] can be major problems, even when flooding is not. Increased runoff reduces [[groundwater]] recharge, thus lowering the [[water table]] and making [[drought]]s worse, especially for agricultural farmers and others who depend on the [[water well]]s.When anthropogenic contaminants are dissolved or suspended in runoff, the human impact is expanded to create [[water pollution]]. This [[Measures of pollutant concentration|pollutant load]] can reach various receiving waters such as streams, rivers, lakes, estuaries and oceans with resultant water chemistry changes to these water systems and their related ecosystems.As humans continue to alter the climate through the addition of [[greenhouse gases]] to the atmosphere, precipitation patterns are expected to change as the atmospheric capacity for water vapor increases.

There are four main types of [[Erosion#Rainfall and runoff|soil erosion by water]]: splash erosion, sheet erosion, [[rill]] erosion and [[gully]] erosion. Splash erosion is the result of mechanical collision of raindrops with the soil surface: soil particles which are dislodged by the impact then move with the surface runoff. Sheet erosion is the overland transport of [[sediment]] by runoff without a well defined channel. Soil surface roughness causes may cause runoff to become concentrated into narrower flow paths: as these incise, the small but well-defined channels which are formed are known as [[rill]]s. These channels can be as small as one centimeter wide or as large as several meters. If runoff continue to incise and enlarge rills, they may eventually grow to become [[gully|gullies]]. Gully erosion can transport large amounts of eroded material in a small time period.Reduced crop productivity usually results from erosion, and these effects are studied in the field of [[soil conservation]]. The soil particles carried in runoff vary in size from about .001 millimeter to 1.0 millimeter in diameter. Larger particles [[precipitate|settle]] over short transport distances, whereas small particles can be carried over long distances suspended in the [[water column]]. Erosion of silty soils that contain smaller particles generates [[turbidity]] and diminishes light transmission, which disrupts [[aquatic ecosystem]]s.Entire sections of countries have been rendered unproductive by erosion. On the high central [[plateau]] of [[Madagascar]], approximately ten percent of that country's land area, virtually the entire landscape is devoid of [[vegetation]], with erosive gully furrows typically in excess of 50 meters deep and one kilometer wide.  [[Shifting cultivation]] is a farming system which sometimes incorporates the [[slash and burn]] method in some regions of the world. Erosion causes loss of the fertile top soil and reduces its fertility and quality of the agricultural produce.Modern industrial [[farming]] is another major cause of erosion. Over a third of the U.S. [[Corn Belt]] has completely lost its [[topsoil]].{{Cite web|date=2021-02-16|title=Study: Over a third of U.S. Corn Belt has lost its carbon-rich topsoil|url=https://www.agdaily.com/crops/third-u-s-corn-belt-lost-carbon-rich-topsoil/|access-date=2021-02-26|website=AGDAILY|language=en-US}} Switching to [[No-till farming|no-till]] practices would reduce soil erosion from U.S. agricultural fields by more than 70 percent.{{Cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Sanghyun|last2=Chu|first2=Maria L.|last3=Guzman|first3=Jorge A.|last4=Botero-Acosta|first4=Alejandra|date=2021-02-01|title=A comprehensive modeling framework to evaluate soil erosion by water and tillage|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|language=en|volume=279|pages=111631|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111631|pmid=33213990|s2cid=227077676|issn=0301-4797|doi-access=free}}===Environmental effects===The principal environmental issues associated with runoff are the impacts to surface water, [[groundwater]] and [[soil]] through transport of water pollutants to these systems. Ultimately these consequences translate into human health risk, ecosystem disturbance and aesthetic impact to water resources. Some of the contaminants that create the greatest impact to surface waters arising from runoff are [[petroleum]] substances, [[herbicide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s. Quantitative uptake by surface runoff of [[pesticide]]s and other contaminants has been studied since the 1960s, and early on contact of pesticides with water was known to enhance [[phytotoxicity]].W.F. Spencer, ''Distribution of Pesticides between Soil, Water and Air'', International symposium on Pesticides in the Soil, February 25-27, 1970, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan  In the case of surface waters, the impacts translate to [[water pollution]], since the streams and rivers have received runoff carrying various chemicals or sediments. When surface waters are used as [[drinking water|potable water]] supplies, they can be compromised regarding [[risk assessment|health risks]] and drinking water [[aesthetics]] (that is, odor, color and [[turbidity]] effects). Contaminated surface waters risk altering the metabolic processes of the aquatic [[species]] that they host; these alterations can lead to death, such as [[fish kill]]s, or alter the balance of populations present. Other specific impacts are on animal mating, spawning, [[Egg (biology)|egg]] and [[larva]]e viability, juvenile survival and plant productivity.  Some research shows surface runoff of pesticides, such as [[DDT]], can alter the gender of fish species genetically, which transforms male into female fish.''Science News.''

Such land derived runoff of sediment nutrients, carbon, and contaminants can have large impacts on global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and marine and coastal ecosystems.Renee K. Takesue,Curt D. Storlazzi. Sources and dispersal of land-based runoff from small Hawaiian drainages to a coral reef: Insights from geochemical signatures. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science Journal. 2/13/17In the case of groundwater, the main issue is contamination of drinking water, if the [[aquifer]] is abstracted for human use. Regarding [[soil contamination]], runoff waters can have two important pathways of concern. Firstly, runoff water can extract soil contaminants and carry them in the form of water pollution to even more sensitive aquatic habitats. Secondly, runoff can deposit contaminants on pristine soils, creating health or ecological consequences.====Agricultural issues====The other context of [[environmental impact of agriculture|agricultural issues]] involves the transport of [[agricultural chemicals]] (nitrates, phosphates, [[pesticides]], herbicides, etc.) via surface runoff. This result occurs when chemical use is excessive or poorly timed with respect to high precipitation. The resulting contaminated runoff represents not only a waste of agricultural chemicals, but also an environmental threat to downstream ecosystems. Pine straws are often used to protect soil from [[soil erosion]] and weed growth.{{Cite journal |author=Pote, D.H. |author2=Grigg, B.C. |author3=Blanche, C.A. |author4=Daniel, T.C. |title=Effects of pine straw harvesting on quantity and quality of surface runoff |url=https://www.jswconline.org/content/59/5/197 |url-access=subscription |journal=Journal of Soil and Water Conservation |date=September-October 2004 |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=197+}} However, harvesting these crops may result in the increase of soil erosion.=== Economic Issues ===Surface run-off results in a significant amount of economic effects.

The frequency with which this occurs is described by a [[return period]]. Flooding is a natural process, which maintains ecosystem composition and processes, but it can also be altered by [[land use]] changes such as river engineering. Floods can be both beneficial to societies or cause damage. Agriculture along the [[Nile]] floodplain took advantage of the seasonal flooding that deposited nutrients beneficial for crops. However, as the number and susceptibility of settlements increase, flooding increasingly becomes a natural hazard. In urban areas, surface runoff is the primary cause of [[urban flooding]], known for its repetitive and costly impact on communities.Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL [http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf u201cThe Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding.u201d] May 2013 Adverse impacts span loss of life, property damage, contamination of water supplies, loss of crops, and social dislocation and temporary homelessness.

Following enactment of the U.S. [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) in 1976, and later the [[Clean Water Act|Water Quality Act of 1987]], states and cities have become more vigilant in controlling the containment and storage of toxic chemicals, thus preventing releases and leakage. Methods commonly applied are: requirements for double containment of [[underground storage tank]]s, registration of [[hazardous materials]] usage, reduction in numbers of allowed pesticides and more stringent regulation of fertilizers and herbicides in landscape maintenance. In many industrial cases, pretreatment of wastes is required, to minimize escape of pollutants into [[sanitary sewer|sanitary]] or [[storm sewer|stormwater sewers]].The U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) requires that local governments in [[urbanized areas]] (as defined by the [[Census Bureau]]) obtain [[stormwater]] discharge permits for their drainage systems.United States.

Essentially this means that the locality must operate a [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|stormwater management]] program for all surface runoff that enters the municipal separate [[storm sewer]] system (MS4). EPA and state regulations and related publications outline six basic components that each local program must contain: Public education (informing individuals, households, businesses about ways to avoid stormwater pollution) Public involvement (support public participation in implementation of local programs) Illicit discharge detection & elimination (removing [[sanitary sewer]] or other non-stormwater connections to the MS4) [[Construction]] site runoff controls (i.e. erosion and sediment controls) Post-construction (i.e. permanent) stormwater management controls Pollution prevention (e.g. improved chemical handling, including management of motor fuels and oil, fertilizers, pesticides and [[De-icing#Roadways|roadway deicers]]) and good housekeeping measures (e.g. system maintenance).Other property owners which operate storm drain systems similar to municipalities, such as state highway systems, universities, military bases and prisons, are also subject to the MS4 permit requirements.==Measurement and mathematical modeling==Runoff is analyzed by using [[mathematical model]]s in combination with various [[water quality]] sampling methods. Measurements can be made using continuous automated water quality analysis instruments targeted on pollutants such as specific [[organic compound|organic]] or [[inorganic chemical]]s, [[pH]], turbidity etc. or targeted on secondary indicators such as [[dissolved oxygen]]. Measurements can also be made in batch form by extracting a single water sample and conducting any number of chemical or physical tests on that sample.In the 1950s or earlier [[hydrology transport model]]s appeared to calculate quantities of runoff, primarily for [[flood forecasting]]. Beginning in the early 1970s computer models were developed to analyze the transport of runoff carrying water pollutants, which considered [[Solvation|dissolution]] rates of various chemicals, [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] into soils and ultimate pollutant load delivered to [[surface water|receiving waters]].One of the earliest models addressing chemical dissolution in runoff and resulting transport was developed in the early 1970s under contract to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).C.M.

Computer modeling of pesticide transport in soil for five instrumented watersheds, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] Southeast Water laboratory, Athens, Ga. by [[ESL Inc.]], Sunnyvale, California (1973)  This [[computer model]] formed the basis of much of the mitigation study that led to strategies for [[land use]] and chemical handling controls.Increasingly, stormwater practitioners have recognized the need for Monte Carlo models to simulate stormwater processes because of natural variations in multiple variables that affect the quality and quantity of runoff. The benefit of the Monte Carlo analysis is not to decrease uncertainty in the input statistics, but to represent the different combinations of the variables that determine potential risks of water-quality excursions. One example of this type of stormwater model is the ''stochastic empirical loading and dilution model'' (''SELDM'')Granato, G.E., 2013, Stochastic empirical loading and dilution model (SELDM) version 1.0.0: U.S. Geological Survey Techniques and Methods, book 4, chap. C3, 112 p. http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/04/c03/Granato, G.E., 2014, SELDM: Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model version 1.0.3 Software support page available at https://doi.org/10.5066/F7TT4P3G is a [[stormwater]] quality model. SELDM is designed to transform complex scientific data into meaningful information about the risk of adverse effects of runoff on receiving waters, the potential need for mitigation measures, and the potential effectiveness of such management measures for reducing these risks. SELDM provides a method for rapid assessment of information that is otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain because it models the interactions among hydrologic variables (with different probability distributions) that result in a population of values that represent likely long-term outcomes from runoff processes and the potential effects of different mitigation measures. SELDM also provides the means for rapidly doing sensitivity analyses to determine the potential effects of different input assumptions on the risks for water-quality excursions.Other computer models have been developed (such as the [[DSSAM Model]]) that allow surface runoff to be tracked through a river course as reactive water pollutants. In this case the surface runoff may be considered to be a [[line source]] of [[water pollution]] to the receiving waters.C.M.Hogan, Marc Papineau et al.
