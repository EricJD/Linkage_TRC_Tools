The convention was designed to minimize [[pollution of the seas]] [[environmental impact of shipping|from ships]]. The objective of the convention is to preserve the marine environment through the complete elimination of [[oil pollution|pollution by oil]] and other harmful substances and the minimization of accidental discharge of such substances.{{Cite web|title = IMO {{!}} History of IMO|url = http://www.imo.org/About/HistoryOfIMO/Pages/Default.aspx|website = www.imo.org|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}  The Marpol Annex I began to be enforced on October 2, 1983, and it details the prevention of pollution by oil and oily water.{{Cite web|title = Marpol Annex 1 -Regulations for preventing oil pollution from ships|url = http://shipsbusiness.com/causes-of-pollution.html|website = shipsbusiness.com|accessdate = 2015-07-20}}Marpol Annex I details the [[Effluent|discharge]] requirements for the prevention of pollution by oil and oily materials.
