The analyzer is self-maintaining by periodical cleansings with [[fresh water]], and therefore requires a minimum of active maintenance from the crew.  The results of the analyzer are sent to a computer, which determines whether the oil content values are to result in overboard discharge or not.  The valves that direct the ballast water either over board or to slop tank are controlled by the integrated computer, and a GPS signal further automates the process by including special areas and completes the required input for the [[Oil record book|Oil Record Book]].All oil tankers with a gross tonnage of larger than 150 must have efficient Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment on board.{{Cite web|title = What is Oil Discharge Monitoring and Control System (ODMCS) on Ship?|url = http://www.marineinsight.com/misc/maritime-law/what-is-oil-discharge-monitoring-and-control-system-odmcs-on-ship/|accessdate = 2015-06-09|date = 2011-02-18}}{{Cite web|title = Regulation 31 - Oil discharge monitoring and control system|url = http://www.marpoltraining.com/MMSKOREAN/MARPOL/Annex_I/r31.htm|website = www.marpoltraining.com|accessdate = 2015-07-28}}The oily discharge is sent out to sea through a pump.{{Cite web|title = Oil in water, oil water analyzer, oil/water monitors by Arjay Engineering|url = http://www.arjayeng.com/arjayeng_oil_and_water.htm|website = www.arjayeng.com|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}  The oily mixture has to pass through a series of sensors to determine whether it is acceptable to be sent to the discharge pipe.{{Cite web|title = ODME S-3000|url = http://www.ksb.com/ksb-kr-en/Products_and_Services/Marine/Marine_System_ch/Oil_Discharge_Monitoring_Equipment/1042132/ODME_art.html|accessdate = 2015-07-23|first = KSB AG, Frankenthal|last = Germany}}Based on regulations, the following values must be recorded by the system: Date and time of the discharge Location of the ship Oil content of the discharge in ppm Total quantity discharged Discharge rateAll records of Oil Detection Monitoring Equipment  must be stored on board ships for no less than 3 years.Oil Discharge Monitoring systems today consist of a computing unit that is installed in the cargo control room.
