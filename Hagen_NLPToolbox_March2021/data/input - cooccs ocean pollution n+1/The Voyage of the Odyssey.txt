In the executive summary of the project, Roger stated that, The Voyage of the Odyssey has proven irrefutably that ocean life is becoming polluted to unacceptable levels by metals and human-made contaminants.The focus of the program was on [[sperm whale]]s, a cosmopolitan species found in every major ocean.{{cite web|url=http://www.whales.org.au/discover/sperm/spermg.html|title=Discovering Whales - The Sperm Whale|first=Graham J.|last=Clarke|work=whales.org.au|accessdate=17 April 2017}} As long-lived apex predators, sperm whales represent a useful [[bioindicator]] of health in the marine ecosystem in a toxicological context, owing to the effects of three key processes: [[bioaccumulation]], [[biomagnification]] and the generation effect. These three processes also make sperm whales, and other [[apex predators]], at great risk from toxic pollution. As mammalian apex predators that nurse their young with milk, they are also relatively similar to us, and thus are seen as the u2018''[[wiktionary:canary in a coal mine|canaries in the coal mine]]''u2019 regarding humanity's relationship with the oceans.The program also had a robust educational and outreach component. In every country they visited, Odyssey crew members met with government leaders, students, teachers and journalists-many of whom kept promoting ocean health after the Odyssey departed for its next research location. The program was also the focus of a major online diary and educational webseries through American broadcaster PBS{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/odyssey/|title=PBS - The Voyage of the Odyssey|work=pbs.org|accessdate=17 April 2017}} produced by Genevieve & Chris Johnson.Aside from collecting the first baseline data set on contaminants in the worldu2019s oceans, the program was witness to a number of other successes, innovations and firsts.
