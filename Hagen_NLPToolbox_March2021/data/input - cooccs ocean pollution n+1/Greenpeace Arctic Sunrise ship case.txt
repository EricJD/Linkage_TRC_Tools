The Dutch government argued that since the ship was outside Russian [[territorial waters]] and outside the {{convert|500|m|adj=on}} safety zone around the oil rig, it was in open sea, and hence outside Russian sovereign rights and jurisdiction. According to [[nautical law]], any actions against a ship in open sea can only be conducted after agreement with the flag state. Hence, the Dutch took the position that the capture of the ''Arctic Sunrise'' by Russia had not been legal. After Russia did not release the ship, the Netherlands filed a formal case with the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] on 21 October 2013 to order Russia to release the Greenpeace ship and the activists who had been on board.{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/netherlands-asks-sea-law-tribunal-to-order-russia-to-release-greenpeace-ship-and-activists/2013/10/21/e68980dc-3ab3-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131022090132/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/netherlands-asks-sea-law-tribunal-to-order-russia-to-release-greenpeace-ship-and-activists/2013/10/21/e68980dc-3ab3-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html |archive-date=2013-10-22 |title=Netherlands asks sea law tribunal to order Russia to release Greenpeace ship and activists |work=The Washington Post |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=2013-10-26 |url-status=dead}}New Zealand Prime Minister [[John Key]] raised the issue with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], but said the Russian judicial process would need to run its course.[http://www.3news.co.nz/Key-raises-Greenpeace-NZers-with-Putin/tabid/417/articleID/316451/Default.aspx Key raises Greenpeace NZers with Putin].
