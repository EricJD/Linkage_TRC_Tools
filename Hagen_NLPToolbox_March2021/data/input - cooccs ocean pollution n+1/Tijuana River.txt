The river is heavily polluted with raw sewage from the city of [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]].==Location==The Tijuana River drains an area along the [[U.S.-Mexico border]], flowing through Mexico for most its course then crossing the border into [[Southern California]] for its lower 5&nbsp;mi (8&nbsp;km) to empty into the ocean in an [[estuary]] on the southern edge of [[San Diego]]. The region straddles the [[Mediterranean climate]] and [[semi-arid climate]] zones, so the Tijuana River and its tributaries often go dry in times of drought.The Tijuana River has two main [[tributary|tributaries]].  One, the Arroyo de Alamar or [[Rio Alamar]], runs in its upper reaches in the United States as [[Cottonwood Creek (San Diego County)|Cottonwood Creek]].  It runs from its source in the [[Laguna Mountains]] southwestward where it is impounded by two dams, [[Barrett Dam|Barrett]] and [[Morena Dam|Morena]], to supply water to the city of San Diego.  Cottonwood Creek is joined by the [[Tecate Creek]] before it enters Mexico where it is known as the Arroyo de Alamar from the point where it enters Mexico to its confluence with the larger tributary, the Arroyo de las Palmas, that forms the headwaters of the Tijuana River within the city.The Arroyo de las Palmas, the main tributary of the Tijuana River, flows out of the mountains to the east into the reservoir behind the Abelardo L. Rodru00edguez Dam.  Downstream from the Rodru00edguez Dam, water flows through Tijuana in a concrete channel to the international border; there it continues west through the Tijuana River Valley for a distance of about nine miles to the estuary and then to the Pacific Ocean.Its lower reaches provide the last undeveloped coast [[wetland]]s in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of [[Imperial Beach, California|Imperial Beach]].  The river has been the subject of great controversy in recent decades regarding [[pollution]], [[flood|flood control]], and U.S. border protection.==Description== (Mexico).]].]]The Tijuana River rises in the [[Sierra de Juárez]] of northern Baja California, approximately 45&nbsp;mi (70&nbsp;km) ENE of [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]]. It flows WNW through [[Tijuana]], crossing the border approximately 5&nbsp;mi (8&nbsp;km) from the Pacific. It flows west, just skirting the international border south of the San Ysidro section of San Diego. The lower 2&nbsp;mi (3&nbsp;km) of the river form the broad mud flat [[estuary]], and the [[Tijuana River Estuary]] is a rich habitat for wildlife, including over 370 species of birds;[http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=669 Parks.ca.gov: Tijuana Estuary]. accessed 6.16.2012 one of these species is the [[Ridgway's rail]].{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Erik |date=7 September 2017 |title=Tijuana River Estuary Endures In Face Of Many Ecological Challenges |url=https://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/sep/07/tijuana-estuary-endures-face-many-ecological-chall/ |work=KPBS |location=San Diego |access-date=2 August 2018 }} It is [[Southern California]]'s largest coastal wetland.{{cite book|author=Barbara Zaragoza|title=San Ysidro and The Tijuana River Valley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhyaAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8|date=23 June 2014|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|isbn=978-1-4396-4592-5|page=8}} It is naturally prone to flooding during heavy rains.
