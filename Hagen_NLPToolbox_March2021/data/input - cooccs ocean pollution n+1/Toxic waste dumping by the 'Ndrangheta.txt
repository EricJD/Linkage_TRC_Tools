Ships with toxic and radioactive waste were sunk off the Italian coast. In addition, vessels were allegedly sent to [[Somalia]] and other developing countries with toxic waste, including radioactive waste cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. The introduction of more rigorous environmental legislation in the 1980s made illegal waste dumping a lucrative business for [[Organized crime in Italy|organized crime groups in Italy]].[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/6198228/Mafia-accused-of-sinking-ship-full-of-radioactive-waste-off-Italy.html Mafia accused of sinking ship full of radioactive waste off Italy], by Nick Squires, The Telegraph, September 16, 2009 The phenomenon of widespread environmental crime perpetrated by criminal syndicates like the [[Camorra]] and 'Ndrangheta has given rise to the term [[ecomafia]].{{Cite book|last=Antonopoulos|first=Georgios A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ul6DAAAQBAJ&q=calabria|title=Illegal Entrepreneurship, Organized Crime and Social Control: Essays in Honor of Professor Dick Hobbs|date=2016-06-16|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-31608-6|pages=86-95|language=en}}A 1995 parliamentary waste commission report spoke of the possible existence of national and international trafficking in radioactive waste, managed by business and criminal lobbies, which are believed to operate also with the approval of institutional subjects belonging to countries and governments of the [[European Union]] and outside the EU. Its conclusions noted interferences and threats against investigators, and were critical of [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]], Italy's state energy research agency, and their management of nuclear waste.==Waste dumping off Italian coast==The [['Ndrangheta]], an [[Italy|Italian]] mafia-type syndicate, has been accused by [[pentito]] [[Francesco Fonti]], a former member of 'Ndrangheta, of sinking at least 30 ships loaded with toxic waste, much of it radioactive. In 2005, Fonti revealed the conspiracy in the news magazine ''[[L'espresso]]''. His statements led to widespread investigations into the radioactive waste disposal rackets, involving [[Giorgio Comerio]] and his disposal company, the Odm (Oceanic Disposal Management).{{in lang|it}} [http://www.archivio900.it/it/articoli/art.aspx?r=relauto&id=5978 Parla un boss: Cosu00ec lo Stato pagava la 'ndrangheta per smaltire i rifiuti tossici], by Riccardo Bocca, Lu2019Espresso, August 5, 2005[[Legambiente]], an Italian [[NGO]] for the protection of the environment, provided the public prosecutor's office with all the data collected by Legambiente since 1994 concerning the disappearance of at least 40 ships in [[Mediterranean]] waters.{{in lang|it}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2009/09/sezioni/cronaca/nave-veleni/cimitero-navi/cimitero-navi.html Dal plutonio alle polveri di marmo il cimitero delle navi radioattive], La Repubblica, September 14, 2009 Over two decades, Italian prosecutors have looked into more than 30 suspicious deep-water sinkings. They suspect that Italian and foreign industrialists have acted in league with the 'Ndrangheta, and possibly government agencies, to use the Mediterranean as a dumping ground.

Former employees of ENEA are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s. Shipments to Somalia continued into the 1990s, while the 'Ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste, including radioactive hospital waste, and sending them to the sea bed off the Calabrian coast.[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/09/italy.nuclearpower From cocaine to plutonium: mafia clan accused of trafficking nuclear waste], The Guardian, October 9, 2007Fonti personally sank three ships and identified a wreck located 28 kilometres off the coast of [[Cetraro]], in [[Calabria]], by environmental workers as MV ''Cunsky'' and says he sank it himself in 1992, complete with 120 barrels of toxic and radioactive waste.

Fonti claims that Italian TV journalist [[Ilaria Alpi]] and her cameraman [[Miran Hrovatin]] were murdered in 1994 in Somalia because they had seen toxic waste arrive in [[Bosaso]], Somalia.According to Fonti, [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] politicians, including former prime minister [[Ciriaco De Mita]], had been involved in illegal disposal operations, using the secret service [[SISMI]] to cover up their connection. De Mita denied the allegations. Fonti also claimed that [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist]] politicians [[Gianni De Michelis]] and [[Bettino Craxi]] intervened to ensure that Italian peacekeeping troops in Somalia turned a blind eye to the transports.[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/world-news/establishment-hit-by-fresh-accusations-in-toxic-waste-scandal-1.920980 Establishment hit by fresh accusations in toxic waste scandal], by Phillip Willan, The Herald, September 20, 2009The huge waves which battered northern Somalia after the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] were initially believed to have stirred up illegally dumped toxic and [[nuclear waste]].
