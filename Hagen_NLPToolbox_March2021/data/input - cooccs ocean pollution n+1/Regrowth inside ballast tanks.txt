This water, called [[ballast water]], which contains aquatic organisms typical of the port of arrival, is stored in [[ballast tank]]s and is ultimately discharged at the port of departure when the ship is ready to be re-loaded. During this process, aquatic organisms capable of surviving in ballast water are released into new environments and can therefore become invasive species, causing serious economic and public health issues.{{cite web|title=Silent Invasion|publisher= WWF International |year=2009|url=http://www.wwf.de/fileadmin/fm-wwf/Publikationen-PDF/Study_Silent_Invasion.pdf }}{{cite web|title=Control and management of ballast water |year=2012|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/control-and-management-of-ballast-water |publisher=gov.uk}} Following the ratification of the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO)u2019s Ballast Water Management (BWM) Convention, commercial ships will have to treat their ballast water in order to comply with maximum discharge standards established for organisms in different size categories (IMOu2019s D-2 Standards and [[US Coast Guard]] Standards). However, some organisms are capable of surviving or even recovering after harsh treatments, leading to regrowth in ballast water tanks before discharge. In order to minimise regrowth and hence avoid exceeding discharge limits, different criteria such as duration of the journey, ballast water tanks capacity and water flow rate at intake and discharge, among others, should be considered when choosing an appropriate type-approved ballast water treatment system (BWTS).== Ballast water treatment systems (BWTS)=={{asof|2012}}, no single ballast water treatment method, or even a combination of primary (e.g. mechanical/physical separation) and secondary (e.g. active chemical substances) methods, can remove or inactivate all organisms in ballast water.Chase, C., Reilly, C., Pederson, J.
