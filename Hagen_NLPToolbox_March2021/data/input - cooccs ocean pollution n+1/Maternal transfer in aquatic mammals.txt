This has become important with the increase in usage of [[persistent organic pollutants]] ([[Persistent organic pollutant|POPs]]). POPs [[Biomagnification|biomagnify]] due to their lipophilic nature and become accumulated in the lipid tissues of aquatic mammals. These lipids are used as energy for the mother during the development of offspring, which releases the [[Persistent organic pollutant|POPs]] into the circulatory fluid. This leads to a transfer of the [[toxicant]]s into the developing embryos during gestation as well as into milk that an aquatic mammal produces during lactation.== History and background ==Marine mammals are exposed to a variety of chemicals throughout their life, mostly through their diet. Once the chemicals are accumulated in the body tissues of the mammals, a portion of these chemicals in the female mammals are transferred to their offspring during gestation and lactation.The degree of maternal-fetal transfer of chemical pollutants is affected by chemical and physical properties of those compounds. [[Lipophilicity]], protein binding, and active transport mechanisms all influence  the absorption and distribution of such chemicals in maternal tissues.{{Cite journal|last1=Aylward|first1=L.

The placenta provides a barrier to some contaminants, but is partially permeable to others, including many organics and certain heavy metals such as [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[cadmium]], particularly when combined with organic molecules.{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kiDfCQAAQBAJ|title=Ecotoxicology Essentials: Environmental Contaminants and Their Biological Effects on Animals and Plants|last=Sparling|first=Donald W.|date=2016-04-18|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780128019610|language=en}}== Mechanisms of Maternal Transfer ===== Lactation ===The transfer of contaminants from mother to pup through [[lactation]] is most likely the largest mass transfer of contaminants, greater than that of in-utero transfers.{{Cite journal|last1=Addison|first1=R.

During this process, toxicants that were stored in [[blubber]] lipids are moved into the milk and subsequently are transferred to the nursing pup.The transfer of toxicants through lactation is driven by the log Kow of the toxicants. Chemical compounds with a high affinity for lipids (a higher log Kow) will more readily be transferred through lactation due to the high lipid content of milk.{{Cite journal|last1=Frouin|first1=Hélou00efse|last2=Lebeuf|first2=Michel|last3=Hammill|first3=Mike|last4=Fournier|first4=Michel|date=2012-02-15|title=Transfer of PBDEs and chlorinated POPs from mother to pup during lactation in harp seals Phoca groenlandica|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=417-418|pages=98-107|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.11.084|pmid=22239965|bibcode=2012ScTEn.417...98F}} The transfer of toxicants from blubber to milk is not fully understood, and selective transfer of contaminants has been observed.Mass balance of toxicants is difficult during lactation due to milk lipids originating from blubber lipids as well as being synthesized locally in mammary tissue. The change in toxicant [[solubility]] between blubber and circulatory fluid as well as the breakdown and resynthesis of blubber lipids and circulatory lipids also contributes to the difficulties of mass balance of toxicants between blubber, circulatory, and milk lipids.{{Cite journal|last1=Addison|first1=R.

Marine mammal offspring are especially vulnerable during the time when their own immune systems have not yet matured. When females provide milk to their young, they can have a dramatic impact on offspring fitness during [[ontogeny]], as well as when the offspring matures into an adult.{{Cite web|url=http://www.seaweb.org/resources/briefings/chempol_mammal.php|title=SeaWeb - Ocean Briefing Book|website=www.seaweb.org|access-date=2016-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602013539/http://www.seaweb.org/resources/briefings/chempol_mammal.php|archive-date=2016-06-02|url-status=dead}} Female marine mammals pass on most of their [[Persistent organic pollutant|POP]] burden to their first-born offspring, while the calf is in utero and afterwards during lactation. The large amount of [[Persistent organic pollutant|POPs]] transferred to the offspring as well as the fast rate of transfer, can sometimes prove fatal.{{Cite web|url=http://us.whales.org/issues/marine-chemical-pollution|title=Marine Chemical Pollution|website=WDC, Whale and Dolphin Conservation|access-date=2016-05-23}}=== Male vs. Female ===The POP [[Body burden|burden]] carried by male and female marine mammals tends to increase with time until they reach the age of sexual maturity. After that point, the burden in males continues to grow, as they continue to absorb POPs from their food. However, with female marine mammals, the POP burden carried decreases after birth but can then increase until the next reproductive cycle.== References ==}
