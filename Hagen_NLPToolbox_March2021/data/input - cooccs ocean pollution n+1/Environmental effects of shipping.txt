According to a [[Discovery Channel]] article on Sonic Sea Journeys Deep into the Ocean over the last century, extremely loud noise from commercial ships, oil and gas exploration, naval sonar exercises and other sources has transformed the ocean's delicate acoustic habitat, challenging the ability of whales and other marine life to prosper and ultimately to survive. Whales are starting to react to this in ways that are life-threatening. Kenneth C. Balcomb, a whale researcher and a former U.S Navy officer states that the day 15 March 2000, is the day of infamy. Although sonar helps to protect us, it is destroying marine life. According to IFAW Animal Rescue Program Director Katie Moore, There's different ways that sounds can affect animals. There's that underlying ambient noise level that's rising, and rising, and rising that interferes with communication and their movement patterns. And then there's the more acute kind of traumatic impact of sound, that's causing physical damage or a really strong behavioral response.

Control of Emissions From New Marine Compression-Ignition Engines at or Above 30 Liters Per Cylinder. Final rule. ''Federal Register'', {{USFR|68|9751}}, 2003-02-28. EPA estimates that large marine diesel engines accounted for about 1.6 percent of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions and 2.8 percent of mobile source particulate emissions in the United States in 2000. Contributions of marine diesel engines can be higher on a port-specific basis.

As of 2006, almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in Europe and North America is of a ULSD type.  However, bunker oil is still available, and large marine engines are able to switch between the two types simply by opening and closing the respective valves from two different on-board fuel tanks.In 2016, the IMO adopted new sulfur-emissions regulations for implementation by larger ships beginning in January 2020.{{cite web |url=http://marine-electronics.eu/sulfur-regulations-in-shipping-industry-from-2020 |title=New sulfur regulations from 2020 |website=marine-electronics.eu |access-date=5 April 2018}}{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imo-shipping-factbox-idUSKBN1YH1PU |title=Factbox: IMO 2020 - a major shake-up for oil and shipping |last=Saul |first=Jonathan |date=2019-12-13 |work=Reuters |access-date=2019-12-19}}{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shipping-imo-insurance-insight-idUSKBN1YG0HM |title=Shipping industry sails into unknown with new pollution rules|last=Fletcher|first=Philippa|date=2019-12-12 |work=Reuters |access-date=2019-12-19}}Of total global air emissions, marine shipping accounts for 18 to 30 percent of the nitrogen oxides and 9% of the [[sulfur oxide]]s.{{cite journal | vauthors = Schrooten L, De Vlieger I, Panis LI, Chiffi C, Pastori E |title = Emissions of maritime transport: a European reference system | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 408 | issue = 2 | pages = 318-23 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19840885 | doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.07.037 | bibcode = 2009ScTEn.408..318S | s2cid = 8271813 }}{{Cite news |first=John |last=Vidal |title=Health risks of shipping pollution have been 'underestimated' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/09/shipping-pollution |work=The Guardian |date=2009-04-09 |access-date=2009-07-03}} Sulfur in the air creates [[acid rain]] which damages crops and buildings.

''BBC News''. Retrieved 1 November 2006, from http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3019686.stm According to Irene Blooming, a spokeswoman for the European environmental coalition Seas at Risk, the fuel used in oil tankers and container ships is high in sulfur and cheaper to buy compared to the fuel used for domestic land use. A ship lets out around 50 times more sulfur than a lorry per [[tonne]] of cargo carried.   Cities in the United States like [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Houston]], [[Galveston]], and [[Pittsburgh]] see some of the heaviest shipping traffic, which has left local officials desperately trying to clean up the air. Increasing trade between the United States and China is helping to increase the number of vessels navigating the [[Pacific]] and is exacerbating multiple environmental problems. To maintain the level of growth China is experiencing, large amounts of [[grain]] are being shipped to China. The numbers of shipments are expected to continue increasing.Schmidt, C., & Olicker, J.

Retrieved 26 November 2006, from https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3109_worldbal.htmlIn contrast to sulfur emissions (which depend on the fuel used), nitrous oxide emissions are primarily a function of combustion temperature. As air contains over 70% nitrogen by volume, some of it will react with [[oxygen]] during combustion. Given that those reactions are [[endothermic]], a higher amount of nitrous oxides will be produced at higher combustion temperatures. However, other pollutants, particularly unburned or partially burnt hydrocarbons (also known as hyperfine particulates or soot), will be more common at lower combustion temperatures, so there is a trade-off between nitrogen oxides and soot.   Other than replacing ambient air with pure oxygen or some other oxidizing agent, the only ways to significantly reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions are via passing flue gasses through a [[catalytic converter]] and/or [[diesel exhaust fluid]] treatment, whereby an aqueous solution of [[urea]] reacts with the nitrous oxides in the flue gas to produce [[nitrogen]], carbon dioxide and water. However, both those options add cost and weight. Furthermore, the urea in diesel exhaust fluid is usually derived from fossil fuels, and therefore it is not carbon neutral.A third option entails the use of wet scrubbers that essentially spray seawater through the exhaust column as it is pumped through a chamber.  Depending on the detailed engineering-design attributes of the wet scrubber, these devices can wash out the sulfur oxides, soot and nitrogen oxides from the engine exhaust, thus leaving a sludge that contains soot and various acidic compounds (or neutralized compounds, if alkaline substances are mixed in with the scrubbing liquid beforehand).{{Cite news |first=Sethi |last=Sargun |title=A Guide To Scrubber Systems On Ships |url=https://www.marineinsight.com/tech/scrubber-system-on-ship/ |work=Marine Insight |date=March 22, 2021 |access-date=September 3, 2022}}  This material can then be either treated via an on-board device (closed-loop system), or it can simply be dumped overboard (open-loop system).  The discharged material can be harmful to marine life, especially in nearshore settings.In a recent study, the future of ship emissions has been investigated and reported that the growth of carbon dioxide emissions do not change with most common alternatives such as [[Ultra-low sulfur diesel]] (ULSD) or [[liquified natural gas]] (LNG) as well as growing volume of [[methane]] emission due to methane slip through the LNG supply-chain.{{cite journal |title= Bayesian probabilistic forecasting for ship emissions |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=231|pages=117540 |year=2020 |last1=Liu |first1=Jiahui |last2=Duru |first2=Okan | name-list-style = vanc | doi = 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117540 |bibcode=2020AtmEn.23117540L |s2cid=219027704 }} Methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide per unit volume, and is only slowly broken down in the environment by various chemical, photochemical and [[methanotroph|biological]] processes.In inland-waters-based applications where sulfur cannot (fully) be removed from the fuel before combustion ([[desulfurization]]), [[Flue-gas desulfurization|flue gas scrubbing]] is commonly employed. However, this would add weight and cost on ships and produce a further waste stream (usually [[calcium sulfate]] if flue gases are scrubbed by being passed through [[calcium hydroxide]] solution) which would have to be disposed of, adding yet further cost. In addition, calcium hydroxide commonly being produced by [[calcination]] of [[calcium carbonate]] releases yet more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. While this stream is comparatively small in relation to carbon-dioxide emissions caused by combustion of fossil fuels, it needs to be taken into account as well, as part of a complete [[life-cycle assessment]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}====Localized air pollution====One source of environmental stresses on maritime vessels recently has come from states and localities, as they assess the contribution of commercial marine vessels to regional air quality problems when ships are docked at port.{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2007.09.071 |title=Inventory and forecasting of maritime emissions in the Belgian sea territory, an activity-based emission model |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=667-676 |year=2008 |last1=Schrooten |first1=Liesbeth |last2=De Vlieger |first2=Ina |last3=Int Panis |first3=Luc |last4=Styns |first4=Karel |last5=Torfs |first5=Rudi | name-list-style = vanc |bibcode=2008AtmEn..42..667S |s2cid=93958844 }} For instance, large marine diesel engines are believed to contribute 7 percent of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. Ships can also have a significant impact in areas without large commercial ports: they contribute about 37 percent of total area nitrogen oxide emissions in the [[Santa Barbara, California]] area, and that percentage is expected to increase to 61 percent by 2015. Again, there is little cruise-industry specific data on this issue. They comprise only a small fraction of the world shipping fleet, but cruise ship emissions may exert significant impacts on a local scale in specific coastal areas that are visited repeatedly. Shipboard incinerators also burn large volumes of garbage, plastics, and other waste, producing ash that must be disposed of. Incinerators may release toxic emissions as well.In 2005, [[MARPOL]] Annex VI came into force to combat this problem. As such cruise ships now employ [[CCTV]] monitoring on the smokestacks as well as recorded measuring via opacity meter while some are also using clean burning gas turbines for electrical loads and propulsion in sensitive areas.===Greenhouse gas emissions===Maritime transport accounts for 3.5% to 4% of all [[greenhouse gas emissions]], primarily carbon dioxide.

While less frequent than the pollution that occurs from daily operations, oil spills have devastating effects. While being toxic to marine life, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), the components in [[crude oil]], are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the [[sediment]] and marine environment.Panetta, L. E. (Chair) (2003). America's living oceans: charting a course for sea change. Electronic Version, CD. Pew Oceans Commission. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles. One of the more widely known spills was the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|Exxon Valdez incident]] in [[Alaska]]. The ship ran aground and dumped a massive amount of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers and volunteers, over 400,000 [[seabirds]], about 1,000 [[sea otters]], and immense numbers of fish were killed.==Wastewater==Blackwater is sewage, [[wastewater]] from toilets and medical facilities, which can contain harmful [[bacteria]], pathogens, [[virus]]es, [[intestinal parasite]]s, and harmful nutrients. Discharges of untreated or inadequately treated sewage can cause bacterial and viral [[pollution|contamination]] of [[fishery|fisheries]] and [[shellfish]] beds, producing risks to public health. Nutrients in sewage, such as nitrogen and [[phosphorus]], promote excessive [[algal blooms]], which consumes oxygen in the water and can lead to [[fish kill]]s and destruction of other aquatic life.Greywater is wastewater from the sinks, showers, [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]s, laundry, and cleaning activities aboard a ship. It can contain a variety of pollutant substances, including [[fecal coliforms]], detergents, oil and grease, metals, [[organic compound]]s, petroleum [[hydrocarbon]]s, nutrients, food waste, [[medical waste|medical]] and dental waste. Sampling done by EPA and the state of Alaska found that untreated greywater from cruise ships can contain pollutants at variable strengths and that it can contain levels of fecal coliform bacteria several times greater than is typically found in untreated domestic wastewater.EPA Draft Discharge Assessment Report, pp. 3-5 - 3-6.{{Incomplete short citation|date=September 2022}} Greywater has potential to cause adverse environmental effects because of concentrations of nutrients and other [[biochemical oxygen demand|oxygen-demanding]] materials, in particular. Greywater is typically the largest source of liquid waste generated by cruise ships (90 to 95 percent of the total). Estimates of greywater range from 110 to 320 liters per day per person, or 330,000 to 960,000 liters per day for a 3,000-person cruise ship.{{rp|15}}A large cruise ship (3,000 passengers and crew) generates an estimated 55,000 to 110,000 liters per day of blackwater waste.The Ocean Conservancy, Cruise Control, A Report on How Cruise Ships Affect the Marine Environment, May 2002. - PDF [http://act.oceanconservancy.org/site/DocServer/cruisecontrol.pdf?docID=141] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190839/http://act.oceanconservancy.org/site/DocServer/cruisecontrol.pdf?docID=141|date=29 October 2013}}{{rp|13}} The cruise line industry dumps {{convert|255000|USgal|L|order=flip}} of [[greywater]] and {{convert|30000|USgal|L|order=flip}} of [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] into the sea every day.[[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL]] annex IV was brought into force September 2003 strictly limiting untreated waste discharge.

It can be either non-hazardous or hazardous in nature. Solid waste that enters the ocean may become [[marine debris]], and can then pose a threat to marine organisms, humans, coastal communities, and industries that utilize marine waters. Cruise ships typically manage solid waste by a combination of [[source reduction]], [[waste minimization]], and [[recycling]]. However, as much as 75 percent of solid waste is [[incineration|incinerated]] on board, and the [[incinerator bottom ash|ash]] typically is discharged at sea, although some is landed ashore for disposal or recycling. [[Marine mammal]]s, fish, [[sea turtle]]s, and birds can be injured or killed from entanglement with plastics and other solid waste that may be released or disposed off of cruise ships. On average, each [[Cruise ship pollution in the United States|cruise ship passenger generates]] at least two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day.The Center for Environmental Leadership in Business, A Shifting Tide, Environmental Challenges and Cruise Industry Responses, p. 14. With large cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers, the amount of waste generated in a day can be massive. For a large cruise ship, about 8 [[ton]]s of solid waste are generated during a one-week cruise.Bluewater Network, Cruising for Trouble: Stemming the Tide of Cruise Ship Pollution, March 2000, p. 5. A report prepared for an industry group estimated that a 3,000-person cruise ship generates {{convert|1.1|e6USgal|m3}} of graywater during a seven-day cruise. Don K. Kim, Cruise Ship Waste Dispersion Analysis Report on the Analysis of Graywater Discharge, presented to the International Council of Cruise Lines, 14 September 2000. It has been estimated that 24% of the solid waste generated by vessels worldwide (by weight) comes from cruise ships.{{cite book |author=National Research Council |title=Clean Ships, Clean Ports, Clean Oceans; Controlling Garbage and Plastic Wastes at Sea |url=https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/4769/clean-ships-clean-ports-clean-oceans-controlling-garbage-and-plastic |publisher=National Academies Press |date=1995 |location=Washington, D.C. |doi=10.17226/4769 |isbn=978-0-309-17677-4}}{{rp|38-39}}{{rp|Table 2-3}} Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board (incinerated, pulped, or ground up) for discharge overboard. When garbage must be off-loaded (for example, because glass and aluminium cannot be incinerated), cruise ships can put a strain on port reception facilities, which are rarely adequate to the task of serving a large passenger vessel.{{rp|126}}==Bilge water==On a ship, oil often leaks from engine and machinery spaces or from engine maintenance activities and mixes with water in the [[bilge]], the lowest part of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] of the ship. Though bilge water is filtered and cleaned before being discharged, oil in even minute concentrations can kill fish or have various [[sub-lethal damage|sub-lethal]] chronic effects. Bilge water also may contain solid wastes and [[pollution|pollutant]]s containing high levels of [[biological oxygen demand|oxygen-demanding]] material, oil and other chemicals. A typically large cruise ship will generate an average of 8 tonnes of oily bilge water for each 24 hours of operation.Shifting Tide, p. 16. To maintain ship stability and eliminate potentially hazardous conditions from oil [[vapor]]s in these areas, the bilge spaces need to be flushed and periodically pumped dry. However, before a bilge can be cleared out and the water discharged, the oil that has been accumulated needs to be extracted from the bilge water, after which the extracted oil can be reused, incinerated, and/or offloaded in port. If a separator, which is normally used to extract the oil, is faulty or is deliberately bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could be discharged directly into the ocean, where it can damage marine life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}Some shipping companies, including large cruise shipping lines, have sometimes violated regulations by illegally bypassing the onboard [[Oily water separator (marine)|oily water separator]] and discharging untreated oily wastewater. In the US these violations by means of a so-called [[magic pipe]] have been prosecuted and resulted in large fines, but in other countries enforcement has been mixed.{{cite news |title=The $40m 'magic pipe': Princess Cruises given record fine for dumping oil at sea |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/02/the-40m-magic-pipe-princess-cruises-given-record-fine-for-dumping-oil-at-sea |work=The Guardian|date=2016-12-02}}{{Cite web |last=Kantharia |first=Raunek |title=Magic Pipe: The Mystery of the Illegal Activity Still Continues on Ships |url=http://www.marineinsight.com/misc/maritime-law/magic-pipe-the-mystery-of-the-illegal-activity-still-continues-on-ships/ |date=2019-10-24 |work=Marine Insight |location=Bangalore, India}}==International regulation=={{Further|MARPOL 73/78}}Some of the major international efforts in the form of treaties are the Marine Pollution Treaty, Honolulu, which deals with regulating marine pollution from ships, and the UN Convention on Law of the Sea, which deals with marine species and pollution.Steger, M.

Maritime governance from the 1950s up to the 1980s has been characterized by intergovernmental decision-making centralized around the IMO.

Four regional initiatives in this context are notable: u201cthe use of special areas in IMO Conventions, the adoption of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Port State Control, the development of the European Union shipping policy domain and the emergence of market-based initiatives by ports and cargo-ownersu201d.While plenty of local and international regulations have been introduced throughout [[maritime history]], much of the current regulations are considered inadequate. In general, the treaties tend to emphasize the technical features of safety and pollution control measures without going to the root causes of sub-standard shipping, the absence of incentives for compliance and the lack of enforceability of measures.Khee-Jin Tan, A. (2006). ''Vessel-source marine pollution: the law and politics of international regulation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press{{page needed|date=September 2018}} Where polycentric governance relies on positive relationships between major actors and conventions, one of the largest barriers to an effective environmental regulation of shipping arises from negative relationships between major actors and conventions, where ambiguous or overlapping jurisdictions result in a range of different issues such as a lack of effective enforcement and monitoring, inconsistent and unclear standards, and inadequate supervision resulting in blind spots in the high seas.{{Cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Shuanghong |last2=Chen |first2=Jihong |last3=Wan |first3=Zheng |last4=Yu |first4=Mingzhu |last5=Shu |first5=Yaqing |last6=Tan |first6=Zhijia |last7=Liu |first7=Jiaguo |date=November 2021 |title=Challenges and countermeasures for international ship waste management: IMO, China, United States, and EU |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0964569121003197 |journal=Ocean & Coastal Management |language=en |volume=213 |pages=105836 |doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105836|bibcode=2021OCM...21305836Z }}Effective regulation of international shipping thus requires more international coordination.

Due to complexities of shipping trade and the difficulties involved in regulating this business, a comprehensive and generally acceptable regulatory framework on corporate responsibility for reducing GHG emissions is unlikely to be achieved soon.

The two main types of MBMs used are emission trading schemes and fuel levies. Both work through putting a price on GHG emissions providing economic incentives for taxed actors to improve their energy efficiency. However, these improvements are also accompanied by a short-term decline in industry profit.{{Cite journal |last1=Kosmas |first1=Vasileios |last2=Acciaro |first2=Michele |date=December 2017 |title=Bunker levy schemes for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in international shipping |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1361920917305114 |journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment |language=en |volume=57 |pages=195-206 |doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.09.010|s2cid=158832137 |hdl=10398/3d831fba-f595-40ad-9991-f0077630f0c9 |hdl-access=free }} Some argue that the current use of MBMs in the EU Emission Trading Scheme could serve as a window of opportunity to reduce GHG emissions in the shipping sector without placing an unnecessarily high burden on the shipping sector.
