Sea glass is [[physical weathering|physically]] and [[Chemical weathering|chemically]] weathered glass found on [[beach]]es along bodies of [[Saline water|salt water]]. These weathering processes produce natural [[frosted glass]].{{Cite web|url=https://bytheseajewelry.com/what-is-sea-glass-or-beach-glass/ |title=What is Sea Glass or Beach Glass |website=bytheseajewelry.com |access-date=2023-10-22}} Sea glass is used for decoration, most commonly in [[jewellery]]. Beach glass comes from [[fresh water]] and is often less frosted in appearance than sea glass. Sea glass takes 20-40 years, and sometimes as much as 100-200 years, to acquire its characteristic texture and shape.{{cite web|website=Sea Glass Journal|title=The Godfather of Sea Glass: Richard LaMotte Boosts the National Profile of Sea Glass Retrieved|url=http://www.seaglassjournal.com/articles/pureseaglass/lamotte.htm|access-date=February 19, 2015}} It is also colloquially referred to as drift glass from the longshore drift process that forms the smooth edges. In practice, the two terms are used interchangeably.==Formation=={{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}Sea glass begins as normal shards of broken glass that are then persistently tumbled and ground until the sharp edges are smoothed and rounded. In this process, the glass loses its slick surface but gains a frosted appearance over many years.{{cite web |title=What Is Sea Glass? |url=https://www.findseaglass.net/what-is-sea-glass/ |website=Find Sea Glass |access-date=31 July 2018}}Naturally produced sea glass (genuine sea glass) originates as pieces of glass from broken bottles, broken tableware, or even shipwrecks, which are rolled and tumbled in the ocean for years until all of their edges are rounded off, and the slickness of the glass has been worn to a frosted appearance.{{cite web|last1=Park|first1=Elizabeth|title=Where Does Beach Glass Come From?|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/beach-glass-come-from-14693.html|website=USA Today|publisher=Demand Media|access-date=November 6, 2014}} Then, the glass will wash to shore where it may be collected.==Colors=={{Refimprove section|date=May 2013}}The color of sea glass is determined by its original source, and most sea glass comes from bottles. Besides pieces of glass, colored [[sea pottery]] pieces are often also found.The most common colors of sea glass are [[Variations of green#Kelly green|kelly green]], brown, white, and clear. These colors predominantly come from glass bottles mostly used by companies that sell beer, juices, soft drinks, and other beverages. The clear or white glass comes from clear plates and glasses, windshields, windows, and assorted other sources.{{cite book | last = La Motte | first = R | title = Pure Sea Glass | publisher = Sea Glass Publishing | isbn = 978-0975324608 | year = 2009 }}Less common colours include [[Variations of green#Jade|jade]], [[Amber (colour)|amber]] (from bottles for whiskey, medicine, spirits, and early bleach bottles), golden amber or [[amberina]] (mostly used for spirit bottles), lime green (from soda bottles during the 1960s), forest green, and ice- or soft blue (from soda bottles, medicine bottles, ink bottles, and fruit jars from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, windows, and windshields). These colors are found about once for every 25 to 100 pieces of sea glass found.Uncommon colors of sea glass include a type of green, which comes primarily from early to mid-1900s [[Coca-Cola]], [[Dr Pepper]], and [[RC Cola]] bottles as well as beer bottles. Soft green colors could come from bottles that were used for ink, fruit, and baking soda. These colors are found once in every 50 to 100 pieces.Purple sea glass is very uncommon, as is [[citron]], opaque white (from milk bottles), [[cobalt]] and [[cornflower blue]] (from early [[Milk of Magnesia]] bottles, poison bottles, artwork, Bromo-Seltzer and [[Vicks]] VapoRub containers), and aqua (from Ball [[Mason jars]] and certain 19th century glass bottles). These colors are found once for every 200 to 1,000 pieces found.Extremely rare colors include gray, pink (often from [[Great Depression]]-[[Depression glass|era plates]]), [[teal]] (often from [[Mateus wine]] bottles), black (older, very dark [[olive green]] glass), yellow (often from 1930s [[Vaseline]] containers), turquoise (from tableware and art glass), red (often from old [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz]] bottles,{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Cornelia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/science/19glass.html|title=From junk to collectible, shaped by time and tide.|work=New York Times|date=October 18, 2010}} car tail lights, dinnerware, or nautical lights, it is found once in about every 5,000 pieces), and orange (the least common type of sea glass, found once in about 10,000 pieces). These colors are found once for every 1,000 to 10,000 pieces collected. Some shards of black glass are quite old, originating from thick eighteenth-century [[gin]], beer, and wine bottles.===Antique black sea glass=== 24 Dec. 2009.

One of the most reliable indicators for natural sea glass is a C shaped design all over the outside of the sample.{{cite web|title=North American Sea Glass Association|url=https://seaglassassociation.org/genuine-vs-artificial/|access-date=2018-07-31}} If the design is located on the piece, it is authentic sea glass, since artificial glass will typically not have that particular design. Sea glass usually comes from broken glass bottles or other household items, so pieces found on beaches will not be perfectly shaped, unlike artificial sea glass, often sold as beach glass.== See also == [[Glass Beach (Fort Bragg, California)]] [[Sea pottery]]==References=={{Reflist|30em}}==Further reading== {{cite web|last1=Park|first1=Elizabeth|title=Where Does Beach Glass Come From?|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/beach-glass-come-from-14693.html|website=USA Today |access-date=November 6, 2014}} ''National Geographic'' magazine, Environment section: The Shard Way, August 2008 http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artnov11macro/JosephineWyman/JW_SeaGlassArticle.pdf==External links=={{Commons category|Sea glass}} [http://seaglassassociation.org/ North American Sea Glass Association] [https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2007/05/01/100003832/index.htm Fortune Small Business magazine article on sea glass collection] [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081000483.html Washington Post article on sea glass collection and sales] [http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artnov11macro/JosephineWyman/JW_SeaGlassArticle.pdf Photographic Exploration of Sea Glass- Josephine Wyman] [https://glassbottlemarks.com/sea-glass-beach-glass/ Brief summary/discussion about Sea Glass / Beach Glass]{{Glass production techniques}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Sea Glass}}}]}}
