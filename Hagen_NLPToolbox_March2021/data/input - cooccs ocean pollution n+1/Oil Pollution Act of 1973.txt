The convention was held in [[London|London, England]] from April 26, 1954 to May 12, 1954. The international meeting was convened to recognize the disposal of [[hazardous waste]] which could potentially yield [[Toxicity|toxic]] [[contamination]] to the [[marine ecosystem]]s.{{cite web |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/oilpol1954.html |title=International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 |date=May 12, 1954 |publisher=Admiralty and Maritime Law Guide |accessdate=December 26, 2013}}The International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 original text was authored in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].
