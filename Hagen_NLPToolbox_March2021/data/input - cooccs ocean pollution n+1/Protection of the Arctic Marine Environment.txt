Founded as part of the 1991 [[Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy]], it assimilated into the structure of the Council following the signing of the 1996 [[Ottawa Declaration]] by the eight [[Arctic]] states.{{Cite web|title=DECLARATION ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ARCTIC COUNCIL|url=https://oaarchive.arctic-council.org/bitstream/handle/11374/85/EDOCS-1752-v2-ACMMCA00_Ottawa_1996_Founding_Declaration.PDF?sequence=5&isAllowed=y}}{{Cite journal|last=Jenks|first=Andrew|title=Canada-Denmark-Finland-Iceland-Norway-Russian Federation-Sweden-United States: Joint Communiqué and Declaration on the Establishment of the Arctic Council|date=1996|journal=International Legal Materials|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1382-1390|doi=10.1017/S0020782900024062|jstor=20698622|issn=0020-7829}} The Working Group claims to operate across the domains of [[Arctic shipping routes|Arctic shipping]], [[Marine pollution|maritime pollution]], [[marine protected area]]s, ecosystem approaches to management, [[Exploitation of natural resources|resource exploitation]] and development, and associations with the marine environment.{{Cite web|title=Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment|url=https://www.pame.is/}} Where necessary, it is tasked with producing guidelines and recommendations for policy improvement, with projects approved every two years by the council. The working group includes representatives from each state, (Canada, Denmark (representing both [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States) as well as its Permanent Participants ([[Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples Secretariat#Aleut International Association - AIA|Aleut International Association]] (AAI), [[Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples Secretariat#Arctic Athabaskan Council - AAC|Arctic Athabaskan Council]] (AAC), [[Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples Secretariat#Gwich'in Council International - GCI|Gwich'in Council International]] (GCI), [[Inuit Circumpolar Council]] (ICC), [[Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North]] (RAIPON), and the [[Saami Council]]) representing the [[Circumpolar peoples|region's indigenous populations]], and a number of observers.{{Cite journal|last=Conley and Melin-|first=H and M|date=February 2016|title=An Arctic Redesign: Recommendations to Rejuvenate the Arctic Council|url=https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/160302_Conley_ArcticRedesign_Web.pdf|journal=Centre for Strategic and International Studies}}{{Cite web|title=The Arctic Council Permanent Participants: Capacity &amp; Support - Past, Present &amp; Future|url=https://arcticyearbook.com/arctic-yearbook/2015/2015-commentaries/149-the-arctic-council-permanent-participants-capacity-support-past-present-future|last=Gamle|first=Jim|website=arcticyearbook.com|access-date=2020-05-28}} The Secretariat for PAME is located in [[Akureyri]], Iceland.==Objectives==The overarching objectives for PAME were formally outlined in the 2009 meeting held in [[Oslo]], Norway.{{Cite web|title=PAME Work Plan 2009-2011|url=http://arctic-council.org/filearchive/pame_work_plan_2009-2011.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000451/http://arctic-council.org/filearchive/pame_work_plan_2009-2011.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-20}} These objectives are: To improve knowledge and respond to emerging knowledge of the Arctic Marine Environment. To determine the adequacy of applicable international/regional commitments and promote their implementation and compliance. To facilitate partnerships, programme and technical cooperation and support communication, reporting and outreach both within and outside the Arctic Council.== Arctic Maritime Strategic Plans ==PAME's objectives, and strategies to further their realisation, are periodically delineated in the group's Arctic Maritime Strategic Plans. As of May 2020, the group has published two such documents; one for the years between 2000 and 2015, and the other for those between 2015 and 2025.{{Cite web|title=ARCTIC MARINE STRATEGIC PLAN 2015-2025|url=https://www.pame.is/index.php/projects/arctic-marine-strategic-plan-2015-2025}}===Arctic Maritime Strategic Plan 2005&ndash;2015[https://www.pame.is/images/01_PAME/AMSP/AMSP_Nov_2004.pdf Arctic Council: Arctic Marine Strategic Plan (2004)]===The first of the Working Group's Arctic Maritime Strategic Plans was approved by the Arctic Council in November 2004. The plan centred around:# The curtailment and prevention of Arctic [[marine pollution]],# The development of sustainable mechanisms for employment of Arctic marine resources,# The conservation of marine biodiversity and ecosystems and# The 'health and prosperity' of all Arctic inhabitants.===Arctic Maritime Strategic Plan 2015&ndash;2025[https://www.pame.is/images/03_Projects/AMSP/AMSP_2015-2025.pdf Arctic Council: Arctic Marine Strategic Plan, Protecting Marine and Coastal Ecosystems in a Changing Arctic (2015)]===The second Arctic Maritime Strategic Plan delineated four distinct goals relating to Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment for the following 10 years. It was approved by the Council in April 2015 at a meeting in [[Iqaluit]], Canada. The plan called for:# The furthering of knowledge relating to the Arctic marine environment and the continuation of the domain's monitoring and assessment structures,# The conservation of ecosystem function and encouragement of marine biodiversity,# Sustainable employment of the marine environment, centred around cumulative environmental impacts and# The enhancement of 'economic, social and cultural well-being of Arctic inhabitants', including the Arctic's indigenous population and the strengthening of their capacity to adapt to ongoing changes in the Arctic marine environment.The second Arctic Maritime Strategic Plan was accompanied by two plans to strengthen its progress: the Implementation Plan[https://www.pame.is/images/03_Projects/AMSP/AMSP_implementation_Final.pdf Arctic Council: Arctic Maritime Strategic Plan 2015-2025, Implementation Plan (2015)] and Communication Plan.[https://www.pame.is/images/03_Projects/AMSP/AMSP_communication_plan.pdf Arctic Council: Arctic Marine Strategic Plan 2015-2025, Communication Plan] The former was intended to provide the Arctic Council with an increasingly structured approach to achieving the Working Group's goals, as well as providing guidelines against which progress could be appraised. The latter aimed to facilitate communication and understanding to ensure the fulfilment of the working group's goals.==Cooperation==PAME works in partnership with The Arctic Council's five additional working groups to construct its strategic plans and suggest mechanisms for their implementation. The five additional working groups of the Arctic Council are:# [[Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme]]{{Cite web|title=AMAP and the Arctic Council|url=https://www.amap.no/}} (AMAP)# Conservation of Arctic Flora & Fauna{{Cite web|title=Conservation of Arctic Flora & Fauna|url=https://www.caff.is/}} (CAFF)# Emergency Prevention, Preparedness & Response{{Cite web|title=The Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response (EPPR)|url=https://eppr.org/}} (EPPR)# Sustainable Development Working Group{{Cite web|title=Sustainable Development Working Group|url=https://www.sdwg.org/}} (SDWG)# Arctic Contaminants Action Program{{Cite web|title=ARCTIC CONTAMINANTS ACTION PROGRAM|url=https://arctic-council.org/en/about/working-groups/acap/home/}} (ACAP)==Projects===== Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment===In 2009, the working group released a major report on Arctic marine shipping, the [[Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment]],{{Cite web|title=Arctic Council: Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment 2009 Report|url=https://www.pame.is/images/03_Projects/AMSA/AMSA_2009_report/AMSA_2009_Report_2nd_print.pdf}} which analyses current and predicted trends in Arctic transport. PAME was tasked to conduct this research after the 2004 [[Arctic Climate Impact Assessment]] concluded that [[Arctic sea ice decline]] is very likely to increase marine transport and access to resources.{{Cite web|title=Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA).

The definition focuses the existence of a distinct geographical area managed in such a way that ensures the long-term conservation and protection of its natural ecosystems.{{Cite web|title=IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/our-work/iucn-green-list-protected-and-conserved-areas|date=2016-05-23|website=IUCN|language=en|access-date=2020-05-28}} There are seven categories{{Cite web|title=Protected Area Categories|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about/protected-area-categories|date=2016-05-27|website=IUCN|language=en|access-date=2020-05-28}} to accommodate the various characters of protected areas that exist globally, with the Arctic states each possessing policy tools to designate and manage these. === Ecosystem approaches to management ===Between 2006 and 2017, PAME produced a total of 11 [[Ecosystem approach|ecosystem approaches to management]] (EA) progress reports,{{Cite web|title=EA Progress Reports|url=https://www.pame.is/document-library/ecosystem-approach-to-management-documents/ea-progress-reports|website=www.pame.is|access-date=2020-05-28}} and has developed a framework for application of the approach to its projects. The framework principles involve identifying the character of local ecosystems before considering them adjacent to the group's assessments, objectives and values. Decisions with respect to the management of local human activity are made based on the outcomes of these processes.{{Cite web|title=Ecosystem Approach to Management|url=https://www.pame.is/index.php/projects/ecosystem-approach|website=www.pame.is|access-date=2020-05-28}}The establishment of the expert group on [[Arctic ecosystem-based management]] (EBM) occurred in 2011, the centrality to the working of the Council of which was furthered in both 2015 and 2017, with council ministers agreeing on the requirement for distinct guidelines for implementing the Ecosystem Approach in the Arctic region.PAME and the Arctic Council define ecosystem approaches to management as the management of human activities based on contemporary, scientific knowledge of local ecosystems. The purpose of the approach is to facilitate management decisions of human activity which balance the exploitation of marine resources with ecosystem prosperity.{{Cite journal|last=Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity|date=2004|title=The Ecosystem Approach|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/publications/ea-text-en.pdf|journal=Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity}}=== Marine resource exploitation and development ===In 2009, PAME released guidelines for the exploitation of Arctic off-shore gas and oil, delineating the Arctic Council's understanding of good practice for the stages of planning, exploring, developing, producing and decommissioning areas and equipment employed in resource exploitation and development.{{Cite web|title=ARCTIC COUNCIL: ARCTIC OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS GUIDELINES, 2009|url=https://pame.is/images/03_Projects/Offshore_Oil_and_Gas/Offshore_Oil_and_Gas/Arctic-Guidelines-2009-13th-Mar2009.pdf}} Since the commissioning of these guidelines, PAME has published eight developing documents {{Cite web|title=Resource Exploration and Development|url=https://pame.is/projects/resource-exploration-and-development|website=pame.is|access-date=2020-05-28}} detailing further development of local regulation on Arctic oil and Gas drilling activities.== PAME meetings ==PAME convenes on an annual, or biannual basis, and meets with the Ministers of the Arctic Council once every two years.
