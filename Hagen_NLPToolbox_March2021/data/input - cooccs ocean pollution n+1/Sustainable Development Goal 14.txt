Therefore, marine research is expensive.{{rp|1}}An annual report is prepared by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] evaluating the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.The Preparatory Meeting to the [[United Nations Ocean Conference|UN Ocean Conference]] convened in New York, US, in February 2017, to discuss the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14. International law, as reflected in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), stressed the need to include governance instruments to consider anthropogenic activities taking place outside of the ocean.{{Cite journal|last=Covert|first=Jennifer|date=2017-06-16|title=Planning for the Implementation of SDG-14|url=https://www.medra.org/servlet/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&doi=10.3233/EPL-170003|journal=Environmental Policy and Law|volume=47|issue=1|pages=6-8|doi=10.3233/EPL-170003}} Concerns regarding ocean health in destructive fishing practices and marine pollution were discussed, in looking at the role of local communities of [[Small Island Developing States|small island developing States]] (SIDS) and [[Least Developed Countries|least developed countries]] (LDCs) to not forget that oceans are a large part of their economies.It was estimated in 2020 that only 2 percent of countries will meet Target 14 by 2030.== Challenges =={{Main|Sustainable Development Goals#Challenges}}=== Large-Scale Marine Protected Areas (LSMPAs) ===Assigning Large-Scale [[Marine protected area|Marine Protected Areas]] (LSMPAs) (at least 100,000 square km in area) aims to reduce the consequences of resource exploitation (e.g. overfishing) and to protect ocean ecosystems by reducing human disturbance in designated areas. However, there are related concerns surrounding LSMPAs that need attention in order to help ensure that the targets for SDG 14 can be met. These concerns cover three dimensions: resource management, conflicts between rival countries, and tradeoffs between people's needs and the environment.{{cite journal |last1=Ou2019Leary |first1=Bethan C |last2=Ban |first2=Natalie C |last3=Fernandez |first3=Miriam |last4=Friedlander |first4=Alan M |last5=Garcu00eda-Borboroglu |first5=Pablo |last6=Golbuu |first6=Yimnang |last7=Guidetti |first7=Paolo |last8=Harris |first8=Jean M |last9=Hawkins |first9=Julie P |last10=Langlois |first10=Tim |last11=McCauley |first11=Douglas J |last12=Pikitch |first12=Ellen K |last13=Richmond |first13=Robert H |last14=Roberts |first14=Callum M |title=Addressing Criticisms of Large-Scale Marine Protected Areas |journal=BioScience |date=2018-05-01 |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=359-370 |doi=10.1093/biosci/biy021 |pmid=29731514 |pmc=5925769 }} The resource management challenge relates to inadequate monitoring and enforcement of the conservation and protection measures. Rivalries between neighboring countries relates to border disputes surrounding assignment of the LSMPAs. Usually LSMPAs involve multiple countries making up disparate adjoined geographic areas. Some countries might use LSMPAs as diplomatic leverage to pursue other advantages.{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Lisa M. |last2=Gray |first2=Noella J. |title=Area expansion versus effective and equitable management in international marine protected areas goals and targets |journal=Marine Policy |date=February 2019 |volume=100 |pages=192-199 |doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2018.11.030 |s2cid=158508117 |doi-access=free }} Tradeoffs between people's needs and the environment relates to addressing people's livelihoods in an equitable fashion. The setting of protective areas can have negative effects on local fisheries and people's incomes.=== Capacity-enhancing fishery subsidies ===Capacity-enhancing subsidies have been provided to developing countries in order to make them more competitive with large fishing nations. But if these subsidies result in overfishing, undermining the [[ecological resilience]] of the resource, there will be no long-term benefits to the communities. Capacity-enhancing subsidies can only solve immediate poverty conditions for the moment. Monitoring of the impact of the subsidies is necessary to ensure that overfishing is not occurring. Also, strict agreements between countries are required since marine ecosystems cross national boundaries. The World Trade Organization is dedicated to implementing Target 6 of SDG 14 (End subsidies contributing to overfishing) and discontinue fishery subsidies. The basis for this is that over 93 percent of the global fisheries stocks are already fully exploited.{{cite journal |last1=Cisneros-Montemayor |first1=Andrés M. |last2=Sumaila |first2=U.
