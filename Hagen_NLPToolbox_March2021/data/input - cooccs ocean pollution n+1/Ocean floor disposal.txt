This is slow enough that it could potentially take millions of years for waste to diffuse through several tens of meters of sediment so that by the time it reaches open ocean it would be highly [[: dilute|dilute]] and [[radioactive decay|decay]]ed. Large regions of the ocean floor are thought to be completely geologically inactive and it is not expected that there will be extensive human activity there in the future.  Water absorbs essentially all radiation within a few meters provided the waste remains contained.One of the problems associated with this option includes the difficulty of recovering the waste, if necessary, once it is emplaced deep in the ocean. Also, establishing an effective international structure to develop, regulate, and monitor a sub-seabed repository would be extremely difficult.Beyond technical and political considerations, the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter|London Convention]] places prohibitions on disposing of radioactive materials at sea and does not make a distinction between waste dumped directly into the water and waste that is buried underneath the ocean's floor. It remained in force until 2018, after which the sub-seabed disposal option can be revisited at 25-year intervals.Depositing waste, in suitable containers, in [[subduction zone]]s has also been suggested. Here, waste would be transported by plate tectonic movement into the Earth's mantle and rendered harmless through dilution and natural decay. Several objections have been raised to this method, including vulnerabilities during transport and disposal, as well as uncertainties in the actual tectonic processes.{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwmo.ca/en/Reports|title=Reports &#124; NWMO|website=www.nwmo.ca}}==See also==[[Horizontal drillhole disposal]][[Ocean disposal of radioactive waste]] [[Deep borehole disposal]] [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] [[Nuclear fuel cycle]] [[Radioactive waste]]== References ==}]}}
