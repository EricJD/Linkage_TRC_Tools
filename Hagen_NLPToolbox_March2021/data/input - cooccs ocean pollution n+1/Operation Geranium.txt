Geranium was so called because lewisite has an odor reminiscent of [[geranium]]s. The materials dumped consisted of two types of bulk container, 60 were of the M14 variety, and another 3,700 bulk containers were dumped as well. The lewisite was shipped to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] from the Gulf Chemical Warfare Depot.{{cite book|last=Vilensky|first=Joel A.|title=Dew of Death: The Story of Lewisite, America's World War I Weapon of Mass Destruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFb9LjlZUw0C&pg=PA109|year=2005|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-11152-4|page=109}} The lewisite was then loaded aboard a World War II merchant ship, the ''SS Joshua Alexander''. The lewisite was then dumped, at sea, 300 miles off the coast of [[Florida]].Brankowitz, William R.

One such dumping operation was reported on by ''The New York Times'' in 1946, 10,000 tons of lewisite was dumped about {{convert|160|mi|km}} off the Charleston, South Carolina coast. Before Operation Geranium, however, lewisite dumping was mostly accomplished by simply dropping loose munitions overboard. In this operation, the Army loaded the merchant hulk with the lewisite containers, sailed the vessel out to sea and then [[scuttled]] the ship with the munitions aboard.Brankowitz, William R.

Most of the 20,000 tons of lewisite produced during World War II by the U.S. was disposed of by dumping at sea. This method of operation and disposal was not used again for some time, though the Army did employ it again.==See also==[[Operation CHASE]]==References=={{Reflist}}{{U.S. chemical weapons}}== External links == [http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-pdf-dumping-indiscriminate,1,6072239.acrobat Map of significant U.S. chemical agent dumps] (Operation Geranium marked at F1)}]}}
