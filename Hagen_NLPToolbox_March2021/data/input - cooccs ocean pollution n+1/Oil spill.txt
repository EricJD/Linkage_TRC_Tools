The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or [[coastal waters]], but spills may also occur on land. Oil spills may be due to releases of [[crude oil]] from [[oil tanker|tankers]], [[Oil platform|offshore platforms]], [[drilling rig]]s and [[Oil well|wells]], as well as spills of [[Oil refinery|refined petroleum products]] (such as [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]]) and their by-products, heavier fuels used by large ships such as [[bunker fuel]], or the spill of any oily refuse or [[waste oil]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}Oil spills penetrate into the structure of the [[plumage]] of birds and the [[fur]] of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less [[buoyancy|buoyant]] in the water. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved.{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0322-04.htm |title=Lingering Lessons of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=2004-03-22 |access-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613042140/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0322-04.htm |archive-date=June 13, 2010}} Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up.{{cite web |url= http://vimeo.com/10216588 |title=Hindsight and Foresight, 20 Years After the Exxon Valdez Spill| access-date=2010-04-30 |author=NOAA Ocean Media Center| date=2010-03-16 |publisher=NOAA}}Oil spills can have disastrous consequences for society; economically, environmentally, and socially.

This corresponds to approximately 600,000 tons annually on a global level. While natural seeps are the single largest source of oil spills, they are considered less problematic because ecosystems have adapted to such regular releases. For instance, on sites of natural oil seeps, ocean bacteria have evolved to digest oil molecules.{{Cite web|last1=Dell'Amore|first1=Christine|last2=Nunez|first2=Christina|date=March 25, 2014|title=3 Surprising Sources of Oil Pollution in the Ocean|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/140325-texas-pollution-oil-spills-animals-science|access-date=2021-05-27|website=National Geographic}}{{Cite journal|last=Burgherr|first=Peter|date=2007|title=In-depth analysis of accidental oil spills from tankers in the context of global spill trends from all sources|url=|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=140|issue=1-2|pages=245-256|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.07.030|pmid=16942835}}=== Oil tankers and vessels ===Vessels can be the source of oil spills either through operational releases of oil or in the case of [[oil tanker]] accidents. As of 2007, operational discharges from vessels were estimated to account for 21% of oil releases from vessels. They occur as a consequence of failure to comply with regulations or arbitrary discharges of waste oil and water containing such oil residues.{{Cite book|last1=Mu|first1=Lin|title=Information Engineering of Emergency Treatment for Marine Oil Spill Accidents|last2=Wang|first2=Lizhe|last3=Yan|first3=Jining|publisher=CRC Press|year=2019|isbn=9780429289101|location=Taylor & Francis Group|pages=1-30|chapter=Emergency Response System for Marine Oil Spill Accidents}} Such operational discharges are regulated through the [[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL convention]].{{Cite web|title=MARPOL Annex I - Prevention of Pollution by Oil|url=https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/OilPollution-Default.aspx|access-date=2021-05-27|website=International Maritime Organization}} Operational releases are frequent, but small in the amount of oil spilled per release, and are often not in the focus of attention regarding oil spills.

Around 90% of the world's oil transportation is through oil tankers, and the absolute amount of seaborne oil trade is steadily increasing. However, there has been a reduction of the number of spills from oil tankers and of the amount of oil released per oil tanker spill. In 1992, [[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL]] was amended and made it mandatory for large tankers (5,000 dwt and more) to be fitted with [[double hull]]s.{{Cite web|title=Construction Requirements for Oil Tankers - Double Hulls|url=https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/constructionrequirements.aspx|access-date=2021-05-27|website=International Maritime Organization}} This is considered to be a major reason for the reduction of oil tanker spills, alongside other innovations such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], sectioning of vessels and [[sea lane]]s in narrow straits.=== Offshore oil platforms ===Accidental spills from [[oil platform]]s nowadays account for approximately 3% of oil spills in the oceans. Prominent offshore oil platform spills typically occurred as a result of a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]]. They can go on for months until relief wells have been drilled, resulting in enormous amounts of oil leaked. Notable examples of such oil spills are [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Deepwater Horizon]] and [[Ixtoc I oil spill|Ixtoc I]]. While technologies for drilling in deep water have significantly improved in the past 30-40 years, oil companies move to drilling sites in more and more difficult places. This ambiguous development results in no clear trend regarding the frequency of offshore oil platform spills.=== Pipelines ===As of 2010, overall, there has been a substantial increase of pipeline oil spills in the past four decades. Prominent examples include [[Environmental issues in the Niger Delta|oil spills of pipelines in the Niger Delta]]. Pipeline oil spills can be caused by trawling of fishing boats, natural disasters, pipe corrosion, construction defects, sabotage, or an attack, as with the [[Cau00f1o Limón-Coveu00f1as pipeline|Cau00f1o Limón-Coveu00f1as pipeline]] in Colombia.[[Pipeline transport|Pipelines]] as sources of oil spills are estimated to contribute 1% of oil pollution to the oceans. Reasons for this are underreporting, and many oil pipeline leaks occur on land with only fractions of that oil reaching the oceans.=== Other sources ===[[Recreational boat]]s can spill oil into the ocean because of operational or human error and unpreparedness. The amounts are however small, and such oil spills are hard to track due to underreporting.Oil can reach the oceans as oil and fuel from land-based sources. It is estimated that runoff oil and oil from rivers are responsible for 11% of oil pollution to the oceans. Such pollution can also be oil on roads from land vehicles, which is then flushed into the oceans during rainstorms. Purely land-based oil spills are different from maritime oil spills in that oil on land does not spread as quickly as in water, and effects thus remain local.==Cleanup and recovery==<!--IMAGE--> dispersant over the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]] in the Gulf of Mexico.]]<!--IMAGE-->.]]<!--IMAGE-->Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved.  Physical cleanups of oil spills are also very expensive.  Until the 1960s, the best method for remediation consisted of putting [[straw]] on the spill and retrieving the oil-soaked straw manually.{{Cite magazine |last=Staff |date=8 October 2022 |title=Oil on the waters |department=Notebook&mdash;50 years ago |magazine=[[Science News]] |type=Paper |volume=202 |issue=7 |page=4}}  Chemical remediation is the norm as of the early 21st Century, using compounds that can herd and thicken oil for physical recover, disperse oil in the water, or facilitate burning the oil off.  The future of oil cleanup technology is likely the use of microorganisms such as [[Fusobacteriota]] (formerly Fusobacteria), species demonstrate potential for future oil spill cleanup because of their ability to colonize and degrade oil slicks on the sea surface.{{cite journal|vauthors=Gutierrez T, Berry D, Teske A, Aitken MD |title=Enrichment of Fusobacteria in Sea Surface Oil Slicks from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. |journal=Microorganisms |year=2016 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=24 |pmid=27681918 |doi=10.3390/microorganisms4030024 |pmc=5039584|doi-access=free }}There are three kinds of oil-consuming bacteria.

Oleophilic, hydrophobic chemical, containing no bacteria, which chemically and physically bonds to both soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons. The accelerator acts as a herding agent in water and on the surface, floating molecules such as phenol and [[BTEX]] to the surface of the water, forming gel-like agglomerations. Undetectable levels of hydrocarbons can be obtained in produced water and manageable water columns. By overspraying sheen with bioremediation accelerator, sheen is eliminated within minutes. Whether applied on land or on water, the nutrient-rich emulsion creates a bloom of local, indigenous, pre-existing, hydrocarbon-consuming bacteria. Those specific bacteria break down the hydrocarbons into water and carbon dioxide, with EPA tests showing 98% of alkanes biodegraded in 28 days; and aromatics being biodegraded 200 times faster than in nature they also sometimes use the hydrofireboom to clean the oil up by taking it away from most of the oil and burning it.{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/emergencies/content/ncp/products/s200.htm |title=S-200 &#124; NCP Product Schedule &#124; Emergency Management &#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |access-date=2010-06-16}}<!-- Unsourced addition could possibly be integrated into or added to above paragraph: Introduce biological agents to the spill to hasten biodegradation.

Dispersants act by reducing the surface tension that stops oil and water from mixing. Small droplets of oil are then formed, which helps promote rapid dilution of the oil by water movements. The formation of droplets also increases the oil surface area, thus increasing the exposure to natural evaporation and bacterial action. Dispersants are most effective when used within an hour or two of the initial spill. However, they are not appropriate for all oils and all locations. Successful dispersion of oil through the water column can affect marine organisms like deep-water corals and sea grass. It can also cause oil to be temporarily accumulated by subtidal seafood. Decisions on whether or not to use dispersants to combat an oil spill must be made in each individual case. The decision will take into account the time since the spill, the weather conditions, the particular environment involved, and the type of oil that has been spilt. --> Watch and wait: in some cases, natural attenuation of oil may be most appropriate, due to the invasive nature of facilitated methods of remediation, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas such as wetlands.{{cite journal | last1 = Pezeshki | first1 = S.

Solidifiers have been proven to be relatively non-toxic to aquatic and wildlife and have been proven to suppress harmful vapors commonly associated with hydrocarbons such as [[benzene]], [[xylene]] and [[naphtha]]. The reaction time for solidification of oil is controlled by the surface area or size of the polymer or dry pellets as well as the viscosity and thickness of the oil layer.

Environmental Sensitivity Index Guidelines, version 3.0. NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS OR&R 11. Seattle: Hazardous Response and Assessment Division, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 129p.=== History and development ===ESI is the most frequently used sensitivity mapping tool yet. It was first applied in 1979 in response to an oil-spill near Texas in the Gulf of Mexico. To this time, ESI maps were prepared merely days in advance of one's arrival to an oil spill location. ESMs used to be atlases, maps consisting of thousands of pages that could solely work with spills in the oceans. In the past 3 decades, this product has been transformed into a versatile online tool. This conversion allows sensitivity indexing to become more adaptable and in 1995 by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]] worked on the tool allowing ESI to extended maps to lakes, rivers, and estuary shoreline types. ESI maps have since become integral to u00a0collecting, synthesizing, and producing data which have previously never been accessible in digital formats. Especially in the United States, the tool has made impressive advancements in developing tidal bay protection strategies, collecting seasonal information and generally in the modelling of sensitive areas. Together with [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System Mapping (GIS)]], ESI integrates their techniques to successfully geographically reference the three different types of resources.{{Cite web|title=Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) Maps and Data {{!}} response.restoration.noaa.gov|url=https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/resources/environmental-sensitivity-index-esi-maps|access-date=2021-05-29|website=response.restoration.noaa.gov}}=== Usage and application ===The ESI depicts environmental stability, coastal resilience to maritime related catastrophes, and the configurations of a stress-response relationship between all things maritime.{{Cite journal|last=Buckley|first=R.C.|date=1982|title=Environmental sensitivity mapping - what, why and how|journal=Minerals and the Environment|volume=4|issue=4|pages=151-155|doi=10.1007/BF02085976|s2cid=129097590}} Created for ecological-related decision making, ESMs can accurately identify sensitive areas and habitats, clean-up responses, response measures and monitoring strategies for oil-spills.{{Cite book|last=van Bernem|first=Karl-Heinz|title=Models in Environmental Research|publisher=Springer|year=2001|pages=127-145|chapter=Chapter 7: Conceptual Models for Ecology-Related Decisions}} The maps allow experts from varying fields to come together and work efficiently during fast-paced response operations. The process of making an ESI atlas involves GIS technology. The steps involve, first zoning the area that is to be mapped, and secondly, a meeting with local and regional experts on the area and its resources.IPIECA, IMO, OGP. (2012). ''Sensitivity mapping for oil spill response'' (OGP Report Number 477). Following, all the shoreline types, biological, and human use resources need to be identified and their locations pinpointed. Once all this information is gathered, it then becomes digitized. In its digital format, classifications are set in place, tables are produced and local experts refine the product before it gets released.ESI's current most common use is within contingency planning. After the maps are calculated and produced, the most sensitive areas get picked out and authenticated. These areas then go through a scrutinization process throughout which methods of protection and resource assessments are obtained. This in-depth research is then put back into the ESMs to develop their accuracy and allowing for tactical information to be stored in them as well. The finished maps are then used for drills and trainings for clean-up efficiency. Trainings also often help to update the maps and tweak certain flaws that might have occurred in the previous steps.=== ESI Categories =======Shoreline type====[[Shoreline]] type is classified by rank depending on how easy the target site would be to clean up, how long the oil would persist, and how sensitive the shoreline is.Gundlach, E.R. and M.O. Hayes (1978). Vulnerability of Coastal Environments to Oil Spill Impacts. Marine Technology Society. 12 (4): 18-27. The ranking system works on a 10-point scale where the higher the rank, the more sensitive a habitat or shore is. The coding system usually works in colour, where warm colours are used for the increasingly sensitive types and cooler colours are used for robust shores. For each navigable body of water, there is a feature classifying its sensitivity to oil. Shoreline type mapping codes a large range of ecological settings including [[Estuary|estuarine]], [[lacustrine]], and [[riverine]] environments. Floating oil slicks put the shoreline at particular risk when they eventually come ashore, covering the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] with oil. The differing substrates between shoreline types vary in their response to oiling, and influence the type of cleanup that will be required to effectively decontaminate the shoreline. Hence ESI shoreline ranking helps committees identify which clean-up techniques are approved or detrimental the natural environment. The exposure the shoreline has to wave energy and tides, substrate type, and slope of the shoreline are also taken into accountu2014in addition to biological productivity and sensitivity.NOAA (2008). Introduction to Environmental Sensitivity Index maps. NOAA Technical Manual. Seattle: Hazardous Response and Assessment Division, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 56p. [[Mangroves]] and marshes tend to have higher ESI rankings due to the potentially long-lasting and damaging effects of both oil contamination and cleanup actions. Impermeable and exposed surfaces with high wave action are ranked lower due to the reflecting waves keeping oil from coming onshore, and the speed at which natural processes will remove the oil.====Biological resources====Within the biological resources, the ESI maps protected areas as well as those with bio-diverse importance. These are usually identified through the [[UNEP-WCMC]] Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool. There are varying types of coastal habitats and ecosystems and thus also many endangered species that need to be considered when looking at affected areas post oil spills. The habitats of plants and animals that may be at risk from oil spills are referred to as elements and are divided by functional group. Further classification divides each element into species groups with similar life histories and behaviors relative to their vulnerability to oil spills. There are eight element groups: birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, habitats and plants, wetlands, and marine mammals and terrestrial mammals. Element groups are further divided into sub-groups, for example, the u2018marine mammalsu2019 element group is divided into [[dolphin]]s, manatees, [[pinnipeds]] (seals, sea lions & walruses), [[polar bear]]s, [[sea otter]]s and [[whale]]s. Necessary when ranking and selecting species is their vulnerability to the oil spills themselves. This not only includes their reactions to such events but also their fragility, the scale of large clusters of animals, whether special life stages occur ashore, and whether any present species is threatened, endangered or rare.[[International Maritime Organization|IMO]]/[[IPIECA]] (1994). Sensitivity Mapping for Oil Spill Response. International Maritime Organization/ International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association Report Series, Volume 1. 22p. The way in which the biological resources are mapped is through symbols representing the species, and polygons and lines to map out the special extent of the species.IPIECA, IMO (1994). ''Sensitivity Mapping for Oil Spill Response'', (IMO/IPIECA report series). Volume 1, p.28 The symbols also have the ability to identify the most vulnerable of a species life stages, such as the [[Moulting|molting]], nesting, hatching or migration patterns. This allows for more accurate response plans during those given periods. There is also a division for sub-tidal habitats which are equally important to coastal biodiversity including kelp, coral reefs and sea beds which are not commonly mapped within the shoreline ESI type.====Human-use resources====Human-use resources are also often referred to as socio-economic features, which map inanimate resources that have the potential to be directly impacted by oil pollution. Human-use resources that are mapped within the ESI will have socio-economic repercussions to an oil spill. These resources are divided into four major classifications: [[archaeological]] importance or cultural resource site, high-use recreational areas or shoreline access points, important protected management areas, and resource origins. Some examples include airports, diving sites, popular beach sites, marinas, hotels, factories, natural reserves or marine sanctuaries. When mapped, the human-use resources the need protecting must be certified by a local or regional policy maker. These resources are often extremely vulnerable to seasonal changes due to ex. fishing and tourism. For this category there are also a set of symbols available to demonstrate their importance on ESMs.==Estimating the volume of a spill==By observing the thickness of the film of oil and its appearance on the surface of the water, it is possible to estimate the quantity of oil spilled.

Of critical importance for the skill of the oil spill model prediction is the adequate description of the wind and current fields. There is a worldwide oil spill modelling (WOSM) program.Anderson, E.L., E. Howlett, K. Jayko, V. Kolluru, M. Reed, and M. Spaulding. 1993. The worldwide oil spill model (WOSM): an overview. Pp. 627-646 in Proceedings of the 16th Arctic and Marine Oil Spill Program, Technical Seminar. Ottawa, Ontario: Environment Canada. Tracking the scope of an oil spill may also involve verifying that hydrocarbons collected during an ongoing spill are derived from the active spill or some other source. This can involve sophisticated analytical chemistry focused on finger printing an oil source based on the complex mixture of substances present. Largely, these will be various hydrocarbons, among the most useful being [[polyaromatic hydrocarbons]]. In addition, both oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic hydrocarbons, such as parent and alkyl homologues of [[carbazole]], [[quinoline]], and [[pyridine]], are present in many crude oils. As a result, these compounds have great potential to supplement the existing suite of hydrocarbons targets to fine-tune source tracking of petroleum spills.
