The goal is to bring about a global collaboration of science, technology and solutions, to help remove some of the floating waste. New catch methods for the debris are being studied, which would have low energy input and low marine life loss.  Technologies for remediation or recycling are being evaluated, to potentially create secondary products from the waste, which in turn could help subsidize a larger scale cleanup.{{cite press release|url=http://www.projectkaisei.org/press/031909%20Project%20Kaisei%20Launches%20Mission%20to%20the%20Plastic%20Vortex_FINAL.pdf|title=Project Kaisei Launches Mission to the Plastic Vortex|date=19 March 2009|accessdate=5 August 2009|publisher=Project Kaisei| website= projectkaisei.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816051353/http://www.projectkaisei.org/press/031909%20Project%20Kaisei%20Launches%20Mission%20to%20the%20Plastic%20Vortex_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=16 August 2009|url-status=dead}} The project has completed two expeditions, one in the summer of 2009, and one in 2010.  New data on the issue has been collected, and more research and planning needs to be done in order to understand the metrics and costs associated with a larger scale cleanup effort. Planning is now taking place for future research and expeditions to take place which would allow for the testing of new capture technologies and equipment, as well as the demonstration of some of the remediation or recycling technologies that could be used.==Initial voyage==In August 2009, the initial study and feasibility voyage phase of Project Kaisei began, conducted by two vessels, the {{convert|174|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=off|adj=on}} diesel-powered research vessel [[R/V]] [[RV New Horizon|''New Horizon'']], and the project flagship, the {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[tall ship]] [[Kaisei (ship)|''Kaisei'']].{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090731-ocean-trash-pacific.html|title=Giant Ocean-Trash Vortex Attracts Explorers|date=31 July 2009|accessdate=5 August 2009|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]}}McFeely, Megan, Earath's Eighth Continent, ''common ground''July/August,2009, pp. 16-17.

Findings suggested that the presence of small debris, of a similar size to the existent marine life, could prove an obstacle to cleanup efforts.Larger debris found consisted of mainly plastic bottles, but also included [[shoe sole]]s, plastic [[bucket]]s, [[Garden furniture|patio chairs]], [[Styrofoam]] pieces, old [[toy]]s and fishing vessel [[buoy]]s, and a large collection of floating debris entangled in [[fishing net]].

The project would later test methods of recycling the collected garbage into new plastic, or commercial products such as [[diesel fuel]] or [[clothing]]. If the initial mission proved the collection and processing technologies to be viable, it was expected that the ''Kaisei'' would lead a full scale commercial cleanup voyage with other vessels, becoming operational within 18 months.==Fundraising and recognition==Ocean Voyages Institute raised $500,000 for the Project Kaisei initial voyages. The SEAPLEX expedition cost $387,000, funded with $190,000 from UC Ship Funds, $140,000 from Project Kaisei and $57,000 from the [[National Science Foundation]]. Project Kaisei is also partnered with the [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]].The group has since been recognized by the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]] in 2009 as a Climate Hero, by [[Google]] as a Google Earth Hero for its work with a video blogging voyage tracking system, and it was recently part of the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] in September 2010.== See also == [[Earth Day]] [[Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup]] [[Junk raft]] [[Kamilo Beach]] [[Marine conservation]] [[Marine debris]] [[National Cleanup Day]] [[Ocean Conservancy]] [[Plastic recycling]] ''[[Plastiki]]'' [[SUPER HI-CAT]] [[The Ocean Cleanup]] [[World Cleanup Day]]==References=={{Reflist}}==External links==[https://web.archive.org/web/20090329105927/http://www.projectkaisei.org/index.html Project Kaisei][http://www.oceanvoyagesinstitute.org/ Ocean Voyages Institute][https://web.archive.org/web/20090804093733/http://sio.ucsd.edu/Expeditions/Seaplex/ SEAPLEX - Scripps Environmental Accumulation of Plastic Expedition][http://shipsked.ucsd.edu/Ships/New_Horizon/ Research Vessel ''New Horizon'']{{authority control}}}]}}
