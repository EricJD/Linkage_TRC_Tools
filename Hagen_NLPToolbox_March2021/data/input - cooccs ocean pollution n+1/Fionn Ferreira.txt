He created a methodology to quantify and collect [[plastic pollution]], with a focus on microplastics. He built several inventions using [[Lego|LEGO]], bits of wood and some microcontrollers to test for these microplastics.{{Cite web|title=Fionn wins again - on home soil|url=https://www.southernstar.ie/news/fionn-wins-again-on-home-soil-4181613|access-date=2021-05-26|website=The Southern Star|language=en}} He entered the national science fair, the [[BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition]], three times, with two of his projects being ''Let Sanils do the cleaning, An investigation into the antioxidant concentration of different berries using the Briggs-Rauscher reaction in conjunction with a photometer'' and ''An investigation into the removal of microplastics from water using ferrofluids.''{{Cite web|date=2019-08-13|title=One of world's top young scientists among Cork students collecting results|url=https://www.echolive.ie/corknews/arid-40145360.html|access-date=2021-05-26|website=echo live|language=en}} Ferreira worked as a curator at Schull's planetarium.== Microplastic removal technology ==Ferreira designed and tested a method to remove [[microplastics]] from water, following what he described as thousands of failed attempts. Ferreira has stated that he was inspired by an article by [[Fermilab]] physicist [[Arden Warner]], who developed a new approach to cleaning up oil spills, using magnetic principles,{{cite news |last1=Armitage |first1=Hanae |title=Accelerator physicist invents new way to clean up oil spills |url=https://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive/archive_2014/today14-07-30.html |access-date=15 August 2021 |work=Fermilab Today |publisher=Fermi National Accelarator Laboratory |date=30 July 2014}} and made a device that uses a magnet-based method to remove the particles from water with extraction rates of 87% (+/- 1.1%). The highest extraction rates observed in Fionn's experiments were for polyesters. He first exhibited the project at the [[Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition]] 2018 where he was awarded the Intel Award, best in category, [[Intellectual Ventures]] Award and a first-place award. Ferreira subsequently exhibited at [[ISEF]] 2018 winning the 1st place [[American Chemical Society]] award, 2nd place award in Chemistry, 1st place for Drug Chemical and associated technologies, a scholarship to the [[University of Arizona]] and a certificate of honourable mention by the [[American Statistical Association]].{{Cite web|title=Full Abstract|url=https://abstracts.societyforscience.org/Home/FullAbstract?ProjectId=14829|access-date=2021-05-26|website=abstracts.societyforscience.org}}In 2019, Ferreira exhibited at the 2019 [[Google Science Fair]] winning the global grand prize award of $50,000.{{Cite web|last=Nace|first=Trevor|title=Irish Teen Wins 2019 Google Science Fair For Removing Microplastics From Water|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2019/07/30/irish-teen-wins-2019-google-science-fair-for-removing-microplastics-from-water/|access-date=2021-05-26|website=Forbes|language=en}}== Education ==In autumn 2019, Ferreira started a [[BSc]] in [[Chemistry]] at the [[University of Groningen]] in the [[Netherlands]] and graduated in 2022 with [[Cum Laude]].{{cite web|last=Boomsma|first=Christien|date=2019-09-01|title=The boy wonder who will save us from plastic|url=https://www.ukrant.nl/magazine/the-boy-wonder-who-will-save-us-from-plastic/?lang=en|access-date=2021-05-26|website=Ukrant.nl}} Currently, Ferreira is following a [[MSc]] in [[Chemistry]] at the [[University of Groningen]].{{cite web|last=Ferreira|first=Fionn|date=2022-11-25|title=I have graduated with a BSc in Chemistry from the University of Groningen with a Cum Laude|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CkIoSShNAJP/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link|access-date=2023-03-25|website=Instagram.com}}== Business ==In 2020, Ferreira founded a business, Fionn & Co., focused on microplastic removal technology.{{Cite web|title=Fionn Ferreira {{!}} and& 2021|url=https://www.andleuven.com/en/fionn-ferreira|access-date=2021-05-26|website=www.andleuven.com|language=en}} In 2020 and 2021 his work was featured by the global campaign by [[Hewlett-Packard]]: ''For every dream''.{{Cite web|title=HP's Best - Premium Quality, High Performance Laptops for 2020|url=https://www8.hp.com/us/en/laptops/premium-high-performance-laptops.html|access-date=2021-05-26|website=www8.hp.com|language=en-us}}== Recognition ==In 2018 the MIT Lincoln Laboratory named a minor planet after Ferreira, following his being awarded 2nd place at the Intel [[International Science and Engineering Fair]].
