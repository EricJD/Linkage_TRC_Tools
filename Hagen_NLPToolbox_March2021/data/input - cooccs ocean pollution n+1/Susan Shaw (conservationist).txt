Shaw (October 24, 1943 - January 27, 2022) was an American [[environmental health]] scientist, [[marine toxicologist]], explorer, [[ocean conservation]]ist, and author. A [[Doctor of Public Health]], she was a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the School of Public Health at the [[State University of New York at Albany]], and Founder/President of the [[Shaw Institute]], a nonprofit scientific institution with a mission to improve human and ecological health through innovative science and strategic partnerships. Shaw is globally recognized for pioneering high-impact environmental research on [[ocean pollution]], [[climate change]], [[oil spill]]s, and [[Plastic pollution|plastics]] that has fueled public policy over three decades. In 1983, with landscape photographer [[Ansel Adams]], she published ''Overexposure'', the first book to document the health hazards of photographic chemicals.{{cite web|last=Cassie|first=Ron|title=Diving deep: Susan Shaw, ocean crusader and environmental health pioneer|url=http://grist.org/pollution/diving-deep-susan-shaw-ocean-crusader-and-environmental-health-pioneer/|date=April 8, 2012}}{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Susan|title=Overexposure: Health Hazards in Photography|year=1983|publisher=Friends of Photography|isbn=978-0933286375}} Shaw is credited as the first scientist to show that [[brominated flame retardant]] chemicals used in consumer products have contaminated [[marine mammals]] and commercially important fish stocks in the northwest Atlantic Ocean.{{cite web|title=Speakers: Susan Shaw: Marine toxicologist|url=http://www.ted.com/speakers/susan_shaw.html}}{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Susan D.|author2=Berger, Michelle L. |author3=Brenner, Diane |author4=Kannan, Kurunthachalam |author5=Lohmann, Nina |author6= Päpke, Olaf |title=Bioaccumulation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers and hexabromocyclododecane in the northwest Atlantic marine food web|journal=Science of the Total Environment|date=May 2009|volume=407|issue=10|pages=3323-3329|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.02.018|pmid=19269019|bibcode=2009ScTEn.407.3323S}} She became the first scientist to dive into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] oil slick following the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion]] to investigate the impacts of chemical [[dispersants]] used in response to the spill.{{cite web|last=Gertz|first=Emily|title=Marine Toxicologist Susan Shaw Dives Into Gulf Spill, Talks Dispersants and Food Web Damage|url=http://www.onearth.org/blog/marine-toxicologist-susan-shaw-dives-into-gulf-spill-talks-dispersants-and-food-web-dam|publisher=OnEarth}}{{cite news|last=Schor|first=Elana|title=Oil Spill Dispersants Shifting Ecosystem Impacts in Gulf, Scientists Warn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/07/30/30greenwire-oil-spill-dispersants-shifting-ecosystem-impac-95608.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 30, 2010}}{{cite web|last=Shaw|first=Susan D.|title=Consensus Statement: Scientists oppose the use of dispersant chemicals in the Gulf of Mexico|url=http://www.meriresearch.org/Portals/0/Documents/CONSENSUS%20STATEMENT%20ON%20DISPERSANTS%20IN%20THE%20GULF%20updated%20July%2017.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112102654/http://www.meriresearch.org/Portals/0/Documents/CONSENSUS%20STATEMENT%20ON%20DISPERSANTS%20IN%20THE%20GULF%20updated%20July%2017.pdf|archive-date=January 12, 2012}}{{cite news|last=Shaw|first=Susan D.|title=Swimming Through the Spill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/opinion/30shaw.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 29, 2010}}Recognized as an outspoken voice on emerging contaminants like plastic,{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Science, Lies, and Politics {{!}} Susan Shaw {{!}} TEDxMidAtlantic|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DdEo-RXI5c|access-date=January 24, 2019}} Shaw traveled globally to raise awareness on toxic legacy of man-made chemicals and its impact on public health and the environment.{{Citation|title=Susan Shaw on the hidden danger of plastic in a world on fire {{!}} Plastic Health Summit 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DktdVr3MTic|language=en|access-date=February 5, 2020}}== Education and early career ==Shaw was born in [[Dallas, Texas]], the daughter of Edward Carrington and Lois (née Bonner) Shaw.She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[University of Texas]] in 1967 with a major in [[Plan II]], an interdisciplinary honors program modeled after the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]] Program.{{cite web|title=Plan II Honors Program Description|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/progs/plan2/about/}} She was selected for the UT-Chilean Exchange Program in 1964, and spent a year in Chile as a [[Fulbright Scholar]].{{cite news|url=https://www.statesman.com/obituaries/p0191100|title=Dr. Susan Shaw|work=Austin American-Statesman|date=February 13, 2022|access-date=February 14, 2022}} Shaw earned two degrees from [[Columbia University]]: an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degree in Film in 1970, and a doctorate in Public Health/Environmental Health Sciences ([[Dr.P.H.]]) in 1999.{{cite web|url=https://www.colorado.edu/cwa/susan-shaw|title=Conference on World Affairs: Susan Shaw|work=University of Colorado Boulder|year=2018|access-date=February 14, 2022}}In 1980, Ansel Adams commissioned her to write ''Overexposure'', published in 1983 as the first book to document the health hazards of photographic chemicals used in the [[darkroom]].
