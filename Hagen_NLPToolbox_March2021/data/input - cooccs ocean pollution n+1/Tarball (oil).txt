Tarballs are an aquatic [[pollutant]] in most environments, although they can occur naturally and as such are not always associated with [[oil spill]]s.{{cite journal| first1= A.

The density of tarballs depends on the solids picked up in the weathering process.{{cite journal| first= R.| last= Goodman| title= Tar Balls: The End State| journal= Spill Science & Technology Bulletin| volume= 8| number= 2| date= April 2003| pages= 117-121| doi= 10.1016/S1353-2561(03)00045-8}} They can range in [[density]] with some being more dense than [[seawater]], which, at 1.025 g/ml, is more dense than the density of [[fresh water]]. When the tarballs are less dense than seawater, they can travel over great distances.They can also be contained like oil and picked up using a variety of methods. [[Boom (containment)|Containment booms]] can be used to isolate tarballs similar to methods used to isolate oil.{{cite journal| first1= J.| last1= Fang | first2= K.
