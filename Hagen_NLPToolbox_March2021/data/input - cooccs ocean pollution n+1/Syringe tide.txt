Later the losses were tallied between 15 and 40% of typical tourism revenue. It was a source of even greater turmoil due to the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|HIV/AIDS epidemic]] of the 1980s.{{cite news|author=Eric Schmitt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/02/nyregion/on-the-jersey-shore-a-summer-to-forget.html |title=On the Jersey Shore, a Summer to Forget |location=New Jersey; Atlantic Ocean |work=The New York Times |date=1988-09-02 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}==Sources and reaction==Officials finally traced the source of the waste to the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]] on [[Staten Island]]. After much deliberation, [[New York City]] was required to pay $1 million for past pollution damages as well as pay for the cleanup. No reparations were paid to the business owners on the Jersey Shore for revenues lost during the months of inactivity.{{cite news|last1=Narvaez|first1=Alfonso A.|title=New York City to Pay Jersey Town $1 Million Over Shore Pollution|work=The New York Times|page=4|date=8 December 1987|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/08/nyregion/new-york-city-to-pay-jersey-town-1-million-over-shore-pollution.html}}In response to [[syringe]] tides of 1987 and 1988, the participants in the New Jersey Harbor Estuary Program (HEP)[http://www.seagrant.sunysb.edu/hep/ New York-New jersey Harbor Estuary Plan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919031549/http://www.seagrant.sunysb.edu/hep/ |date=2006-09-19 }}, accessed February 19, 2007 implemented an extremely successful effort, known as the Short-term Floatables Action Plan. The plan has been implemented since 1989 and is supposed to curtail floatable debris wash-ups by intercepting debris slicks within the Harbor. With this plan, the extent of beach closures declined from over {{convert|70|mi|km}} in 1988 to fewer than {{convert|4|mi|km}} in 1989, and closures have remained at a low level in later years. The Short-term Floatables Action Plan has four key elements:[http://library.marist.edu/diglib/EnvSci/archives/hudsmgmt/ny-njharborestuaryprogram/debris.html Floatable Debris], accessed February 19, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524210352/http://library.marist.edu/diglib/EnvSci/archives/hudsmgmt/ny-njharborestuaryprogram/debris.html |date=May 24, 2005 }}Surveillance: Environmental organizations conduct regular air and sea patrols of the Harbor to look for and report slicks of floatable debris.Regular Cleanups: The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE) use cleanup vessels to collect floatable debris in the Harbor and focuses its activities on conditions when slicks are most likely to occur.Non-routine Cleanups: USACE also attempts to capture additional debris slicks in the Harbor when they are detected and reported.Communications Network: [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] coordinates a reporting network as well as cleanup activities among all the program participants.==Popular culture==The Syringe Tide is referenced in [[Billy Joel]]'s 1989 hit single [[We Didn't Start the Fire]] by the line Hypodermics on the shore.In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode [[The Old Man and the C Student|The Old Man and the 'C' Student]], when punishing the students Principal [[Seymour Skinner|Skinner]] sends [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] to the beach to pick up all this medical waste that's washed up on the shore. Milhouse accidentally pricks himself on a [[syringe]], and Skinner replies Well, just keep working. You'll prick yourself with the [[antidote]] sooner or later.The 1988 [[Skinny Puppy]] song [[VIVIsectVI|Hospital Waste]] was written about the incident.In the episode The Gang Goes to the Jersey Shore from ''[[It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia]]'', Frank and Mac are on a beach covered in needles but blame it on New Jersey being the steroid capital of the world.==See also==[[Marine debris]][[Ocean Dumping Act]][[Medical Waste Tracking Act]]==References==}
