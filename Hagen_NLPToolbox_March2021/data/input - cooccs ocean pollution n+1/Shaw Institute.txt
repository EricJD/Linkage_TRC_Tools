Shaw is globally recognized for pioneering high-impact environmental research on [[ocean pollution]], [[climate change]], [[oil spill]]s, and [[Plastic pollution|plastics]] that has fueled public policy over three decades. In 1983, with landscape photographer [[Ansel Adams]], she published ''Overexposure'', the first book to document the health hazards of photographic chemicals. Shaw is credited as the first scientist to show that [[brominated flame retardant]] chemicals used in consumer products have contaminated [[marine mammals]] and commercially important fish stocks in the northwest [[Atlantic Ocean]]. She became the first scientist to dive into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] oil slick following the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion]] to investigate the impacts of chemical [[dispersants]] used in response to the spill.{{Citation|last=Wells|first=PG|chapter=The Toxicity of Oil Spill Dispersants to Marine Organisms: A Current Perspective|pages=177-177-26|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=9780803104006|doi=10.1520/stp30237s|title=Oil Spill Chemical Dispersants: Research, Experience, and Recommendations|year=1984}}{{Cite journal|last=WILSON|first=ELIZABETH|date=2010-08-09|journal=Chemical & Engineering News|volume=88|issue=32|pages=5|doi=10.1021/cen080510133052|issn=0009-2347|title=Dispersants' Effects Debated}}{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Joyce M.|date=2010-01-01|title=History of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory|journal=Gulf of Mexico Science|volume=28|issue=1|doi=10.18785/goms.2801.13|issn=1087-688X|doi-access=free}}{{Citation|last=Mccarthy|first=Lillah|chapter=Swimming: III|date=1990|pages=198|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781349054046|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-05402-2_109|title=Shaw|doi-access=free}}As of 2019, the institute conducts research into [[Marine pollution|ocean pollution]], plastics and microplastics, chemical health threats, and [[climate change]] in the [[Gulf of Maine]] and raises awareness of the toxic legacy of man-made chemicals on human health and marine environments. The institute is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] nonprofit scientific research organization funded primarily by grants and charitable contributions.== Milestones ==In 1990, Shaw established the Marine & Environmental Research Institute (MERI) and began long-term marine sentinels research on contaminants and [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting]] effects in [[marine mammal]]s that became the Institute's central focus over the next two decades.{{Cite journal|last1=Larsson|first1=D.G.J.|last2=Hällman|first2=H.|last3=Förlin|first3=L.|date=July 2000|title=Skewed embryonic sex ratios in a viviparous fish: a result of endocrine disruption?|journal=Marine Environmental Research|volume=50|issue=1-5|pages=191-192|doi=10.1016/s0141-1136(00)00172-0|issn=0141-1136}} In 2000, the Institute hosted its first international conference: The Atlantic Coast Contaminant Workshop ACCW 2000, ''Endocrine Disruptors in the Marine Environment: Impacts on Marine Wildlife and Human Health'', uniting international wildlife and human health scientists.{{Cite book|title=Toxic pollution in Casco Bay : sources and impacts|last=Partnership.|first=Casco Bay Estuary|date=2007|publisher=Casco Bay Estuary Partnership|isbn=978-0939561360|oclc=132687763}}{{Cite journal|date=November 1989|title=Marine mammals at threat from PCBs|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=20|issue=11|pages=539-540|doi=10.1016/0025-326x(89)90339-1|issn=0025-326X}} Shortly thereafter, the Institute launched a coastal monitoring program, a lecture series, and education programs.In 2000, Shaw Institute began long-term research focused on marine [[sentinel species]] to characterize the extent of contamination of the northwest Atlantic [[marine ecosystem]] from Maine to [[New York (state)|New York]], funded by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).{{Cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan D.|last2=Brenner|first2=Diane|last3=Bourakovsky|first3=Anna|last4=Mahaffey|first4=Christie A.|last5=Perkins|first5=Christopher R.|date=October 2005|title=Polychlorinated biphenyls and chlorinated pesticides in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina concolor) from the northwestern Atlantic coast|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=50|issue=10|pages=1069-1084|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2005.04.010|issn=0025-326X|pmid=15907943}} This work has shown that levels of toxic chemicals, such as [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), in northwest Atlantic harbor seals are among the highest in the world.{{Citation|title=Songs and Ballads of the Maine Lumberjacks with Other Songs from Maine|year=1924|chapter=The Bangor Fire|pages=176-179|publisher=Harvard University Press|doi=10.4159/harvard.9780674282360.c51|isbn=9780674282360}}{{Cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan D.|last2=Brenner|first2=Diane|last3=Bourakovsky|first3=Anna|last4=Mahaffey|first4=Christie A.|last5=Perkins|first5=Christopher R.|date=October 2005|title=Polychlorinated biphenyls and chlorinated pesticides in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina concolor) from the northwestern Atlantic coast|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=50|issue=10|pages=1069-1084|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2005.04.010|issn=0025-326X|pmid=15907943}}In 2002, the Institute convened the Gulf of Maine Forum: Protecting Our Coastal and Offshore Waters in Blue Hill in conjunction with the Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment, representing New England states and Canadian provinces.{{Cite journal|last=Fairchild|first=Elizabeth A.|date=January 2017|title=Indications of Offshore Spawning by Southern Gulf of Maine Winter Flounder|journal=Marine and Coastal Fisheries|volume=9|issue=1|pages=493-503|doi=10.1080/19425120.2017.1365786|issn=1942-5120|doi-access=free}} A year later, the Shaw Institute begins its student internships program for scientific research and monitoring. In 2004, the Ocean Environment Lecture Series is launched, attracting international experts in a variety of fields. That same year, the long-term Blue Hill Bay Monitoring Project, the first bay-wide health assessment of its kind, is established to produce a ten-year baseline dataset on conditions and issues of concern. In 2014, the project expands geographically to include Penobscot Bay and targets research on microplastics, invasive species, and seafood contamination.In 2012, the Institute pioneered [[microplastics]] research in Blue Hill Bay, Maine.{{Citation|chapter=Sources of macro and microplastics|date=2016-05-11|pages=35-64|publisher=United Nations|isbn=9789210601603|doi=10.18356/f4eb59e6-en|title=Marine Plastic Debris and Microplastics}} Alarming findings about the presence of microplastics in coastal waters prompted concern for human health (via seafood consumption).In 2013, Shaw was lead investigator of a study that tested a group of firefighters in [[San Francisco]]{{Cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan D.|last2=Berger|first2=Michelle L.|last3=Harris|first3=Jennifer H.|last4=Yun|first4=Se Hun|last5=Wu|first5=Qian|last6=Liao|first6=Chunyang|last7=Blum|first7=Arlene|last8=Stefani|first8=Anthony|last9=Kannan|first9=Kurunthachalam|date=June 2013|title=Persistent organic pollutants including polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in firefighters from Northern California|journal=Chemosphere|volume=91|issue=10|pages=1386-1394|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.12.070|pmid=23395527|issn=0045-6535|bibcode=2013Chmsp..91.1386S}} and found that their blood contains high levels of flame retardants and cancer-causing chemicals such as [[dioxins]] and [[furans]], produced by the burning of flame-retarded household materials.{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Susan|date=January 2010|title=Halogenated Flame Retardants: Do the Fire Safety Benefits Justify the Risks?|journal=Reviews on Environmental Health|volume=25|issue=4|doi=10.1515/reveh.2010.25.4.261|issn=2191-0308|pmid=21268442|pages=261-305|s2cid=20573319}}{{Cite journal|date=1839-02-06|title=Dr. Marshall Hall on Puerperal Diseases|journal=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal|volume=19|issue=27|pages=421-424|doi=10.1056/nejm183902060192701|issn=0096-6762}} Based on these findings, in 2014, the Institute announced plans for a long-term study of chemical exposure and cancer risk in U.S. firefighters named the National Fire Fighter Cancer Biomarker Study, funded in part by [[IAFF Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial|IAFF]] and IAB.Starting in 2017, the Institute began a multi-year project and partnership with researchers from Sweden, Greenland and Iceland to assess the converging impacts of climate change and flame retardant chemicals on marine mammals from the US Atlantic, [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], and [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] seas.== Plastics Research ==In 2012, Shaw Institute conducted the first [[microplastics]] study of its kind in the Gulf of Maine. Using new collection methods, they detected an average of 17 microplastic fragments per liter in local seawater samples. These high results prompted the institute to monitor input sites including stream and river mouths around Blue Hill Bay.In 2014, the Institute developed a study to measure microplastics in Maine seafood, which identified surprisingly large numbers of microplastic fragments in oysters and mussels. Shaw Institute also conducted analysis of microplastics in tissues of mussels, fish, and marine mammals.{{Cite web|url=https://wgme.com/news/local/microplastics-found-in-gulf-of-maine|title=Microplastics found in Gulf of Maine|last=|first=|date=23 November 2018|website=WGME.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}  These numbers prompted questions about bioaccumulation in human consumers.
