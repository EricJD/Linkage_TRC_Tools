The workshops consist of assembling piece work  which involves drilling holes through plastic and stitching the plastic to wire mesh.  These panels will later be fastened by Lead Artist, Angela Haseltine Pozzi, and her team, to welded structures and other artwork as part of Washed Ashore's Traveling Exhibits.==References=={{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Washed Ashore}}}]}}
