This product has been used by the [[United States Navy]], State of California Fish and Game and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). Marlin Supply Inc. is the main distributor of this product with laboratories in [[San Francisco]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]] and [[Mexico]]. Nokomis 3 has been shown in studies to increase the rate of [[biodegradation]] of petroleum [[Hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons]] with one study observing the degradation rate increased to 5.07u2009u00b1u20090.37 mg Lu22121 dayu22121 from 2.39u2009u00b1u20090.22 mg Lu22121 dayu22121.Uribe-Flores, Maru00eda Magdalena, et al. u201cAssessing the Effect of Chemical Dispersant Nokomis 3-F4 on the Degradation of a Heavy Crude Oil in Water by a Marine Microbial Consortium.u201d Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, vol. 108, no. 1, 5 May 2021, pp. 93-98, 10.1007/s00128-021-03247-y. Accessed 21 Sept. 2022.When the product is released out of an airplane or aerial applied, it has an increased viscosity, causing a better chance for it to reach the ground.http://nokomis3.com/ Nokomis 3 Hayward CAThis product is designed specifically to clean up No. 2 Oil Fuel in bodies of water. Nokomis 3 is a base on the pH scale and is completely water [[soluble]].http://www.epa.gov/OEM/content/ncp/products/nokomis3AA.htm United States Environmental Protection Agency== Nokomis 3-AA ==This specific product of Nokomis 3 is a water based [[colloid]]. Nokomis 3-AA can be applied through spray nozzles on workboats or ships and for best use the propeller of the boats can be helpful with mixing the product into the water for the most effect.http://www.nokomis3.com/pdfs/Nokomis-3AA-datasheet-en.pdf Nokomis 3-AA Data Sheet== Nokomis 3-F4 ==The second design of Nokomis 3 is the Nokomis 3-F4. It is made with a higher [[viscosity]], increasing the chance that the full product with reach the water's surface.  It is not always applied by plane but can also be sprayed through nozzles to the top of the water's surface. Depending on the situation and the size of the oil spill, it can be applied either diluted or at full strength.http://www.nokomis3.com/pdfs/Nokomis-3F4-datasheet-en.pdf Nokomis 3-F4 Data Sheet== See also ==[[Oil spill]][[Crude oil]][[Bioremediation]][[Microorganisms]][[Biological agent]]== References =={{Reflist|2}}==External links==[http://nokomis3.com/ Nokomis 3][https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/nokomis-3-f4 Nokomis 3-F4 EPA Technical Product Bulletin]{{Environmental-disaster-stub}}}]}}
