[[Air pollution]] is also a contributing factor by carrying off iron, carbonic acid, [[nitrogen]], silicon, sulfur, [[pesticides]] or dust particles into the ocean.{{Cite web|last=Duce|first=Robert, Galloway, J. and Liss, P.|date=2009|title=The Impacts of Atmospheric Deposition to the Ocean on Marine Ecosystems and Climate WMO Bulletin Vol 58 (1)|url=https://public.wmo.int/en/bulletin/impacts-atmospheric-deposition-ocean-marine-ecosystems-and-climate|access-date=22 September 2020}} The pollution often comes from [[nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source]]s such as agricultural [[surface runoff|runoff]], wind-blown [[debris]], and dust. These nonpoint sources are largely due to runoff that enters the ocean through rivers, but wind-blown [[debris]] and dust can also play a role, as these pollutants can settle into waterways and oceans.{{cite web |title=What is the biggest source of pollution in the ocean? |url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/pollution.html |access-date=2022-09-21 |website=National Ocean Service (US) |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |location=Silver Spring, MD}} Pathways of pollution include direct discharge, land runoff, [[Environmental effects of shipping|ship pollution]], [[bilge pollution]], atmospheric pollution and, potentially, [[deep sea mining]].The types of marine pollution can be grouped as pollution from [[marine debris]], [[Plastic soup|plastic pollution]], including [[microplastics]], [[ocean acidification]], [[nutrient pollution]], toxins and underwater noise. Plastic pollution in the ocean is a type of marine pollution by [[Plastic pollution|plastics]], ranging in size from large original material such as bottles and bags, down to [[microplastics]] formed from the fragmentation of plastic material. Marine debris is mainly discarded human rubbish which floats on, or is suspended in the ocean. Plastic pollution is harmful to [[marine life]].Another concern is the runoff of [[nutrient]]s (nitrogen and phosphorus) from [[Intensive farming|intensive agriculture]], and the disposal of untreated or partially treated [[sewage]] to rivers and subsequently oceans. These [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] nutrients (which are also contained in [[fertilizer]]s) stimulate [[phytoplankton]] and [[macroalgal]] growth, which can lead to harmful [[algal bloom]]s ([[eutrophication]]) which can be harmful to humans as well as marine creatures. Excessive algal growth can also smother sensitive [[coral reef]]s and lead to [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and coral health. A second major concern is that the degradation of [[Algal bloom|algal blooms]] can lead to consumption of [[oxygen]] in coastal waters, a situation that may worsen with [[climate change]] as warming reduces vertical mixing of the water column.{{Cite journal|last1=Breitburg|first1=Denise|last2=Levin|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Oschlies|first3=Andreas|last4=Grégoire|first4=Marilaure|last5=Chavez|first5=Francisco P.|last6=Conley|first6=Daniel J.|last7=Garu00e7on|first7=Véronique|last8=Gilbert|first8=Denis|last9=Gutiérrez|first9=Dimitri|last10=Isensee|first10=Kirsten|last11=Jacinto|first11=Gil S.|date=2018-01-05|title=Declining oxygen in the global ocean and coastal waters|journal=Science|language=en|volume=359|issue=6371|pages=eaam7240|doi=10.1126/science.aam7240|pmid=29301986|bibcode=2018Sci...359M7240B|issn=0036-8075|doi-access=free}}Many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by [[plankton]] and [[benthos|benthic animals]], most of which are either [[deposit feeder]]s or [[filter feeder]]s. In this way, the toxins are [[biomagnification|concentrated upward]] within ocean [[food chain]]s. When pesticides are incorporated into the [[marine ecosystem]], they quickly become absorbed into marine [[food web]]s. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause [[mutation]]s, as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web. [[Toxic metal]]s can also be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behavior, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many [[compound feed|animal feeds]] have a high [[fish meal]] or [[fish hydrolysate]] content. In this way, [[Toxin|marine toxins]] can be transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products.==Pathways of pollution== shown above, it is often the pollutants that cannot be seen that cause most harm.]]{{See also|Water pollution}}There are many ways to categorize and examine the inputs of pollution into marine ecosystems. There are three main types of inputs of pollution into the ocean: direct discharge of waste into the oceans, runoff into the waters due to rain, and pollutants released from the atmosphere.{{Cite web |url=http://www.offshore-environment.com/anthropogenicimpact.html |title=Anthropogenic impact in the sea and marine pollution |last=Patin, S.A. |website=offshore-environment.com |access-date=1 February 2018}}One common path of entry by [[contaminant]]s to the sea are rivers. The evaporation of water from oceans exceeds precipitation. The balance is restored by rain over the continents entering rivers and then being returned to the sea. The [[Hudson River]] in [[New York State]] and the [[Raritan River]] in [[New Jersey]], which empty at the northern and southern ends of [[Staten Island]], are a source of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] contamination of [[zooplankton]] ([[copepod]]s) in the open ocean. The highest concentration in the filter-feeding [[copepod]]s is not at the mouths of these rivers but {{convert|70|mi|km}} south, nearer [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], because water flows close to the coast. It takes a few days before toxins are taken up by the [[plankton]].Pollution is often classed as [[point source]] or [[nonpoint source pollution]]. Point source pollution occurs when there is a single, identifiable, localized source of the pollution. An example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the ocean. Pollution such as this occurs particularly in [[Developing country|developing nations]].{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} Nonpoint source pollution occurs when the pollution is from ill-defined and diffuse sources. These can be difficult to regulate. Agricultural [[surface runoff|runoff]] and wind blown [[debris]] are prime examples.===Direct discharge=== in the Rio Tinto River]]{{See also|Sewerage|Industrial waste|Environmental impact of mining}}Pollutants enter rivers and the sea directly from urban [[sewerage]] and [[industrial waste]] discharges, sometimes in the form of [[hazardous waste|hazardous]] and [[toxic waste]]s, or in the form of plastics.{{cn|date=April 2023}}In a study published by ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Jambeck ''et al.''

It can result in an increase in the ecosystem's [[primary productivity]] (excessive plant growth and decay), and further effects including lack of oxygen and severe reductions in water quality, fish, and other animal populations. [[Nutrient pollution]], a form of [[water pollution]], refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually [[nitrate]]s or [[phosphate]]s, stimulate algae growth. Such blooms are naturally occurring but may be increasing as a result of anthropogenic inputs or alternatively may be something that is now more closely monitored and so more frequently reported.{{Cite journal|last1=Hallegraeff|first1=Gustaaf M.|last2=Anderson|first2=Donald M.|last3=Belin|first3=Catherine|last4=Bottein|first4=Marie-Yasmine Dechraoui|last5=Bresnan|first5=Eileen|last6=Chinain|first6=Mireille|last7=Enevoldsen|first7=Henrik|last8=Iwataki|first8=Mitsunori|last9=Karlson|first9=Bengt|last10=McKenzie|first10=Cynthia H.|last11=Sunesen|first11=Inés|date=2021|title=Perceived global increase in algal blooms is attributable to intensified monitoring and emerging bloom impacts|journal=Communications Earth & Environment|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=117|doi=10.1038/s43247-021-00178-8|pmid=37359131 |pmc=10289804 |bibcode=2021ComEE...2..117H|issn=2662-4435|s2cid=235364600|doi-access=free}}The biggest culprit are rivers that empty into the ocean, and with it the many chemicals used as [[fertilizer]]s in agriculture as well as waste from [[livestock]] and [[human]]s.

The tetrablock copolymer acts as a laminate between the PE and iPP which enables for an easier breakdown but still be tough.  Through more awareness, individuals will become more cognizant of their carbon footprints. Also, from research and technology, more strides can be made to aid in the plastic pollution problem.{{cite journal |last1=Austin |first1=Harry P. |last2=Allen |first2=Mark D. |last3=Donohoe |first3=Bryon S. |last4=Rorrer |first4=Nicholas A. |last5=Kearns |first5=Fiona L. |last6=Silveira |first6=Rodrigo L. |last7=Pollard |first7=Benjamin C. |last8=Dominick |first8=Graham |last9=Duman |first9=Ramona |last10=El Omari |first10=Kamel |last11=Mykhaylyk |first11=Vitaliy |last12=Wagner |first12=Armin |last13=Michener |first13=William E. |last14=Amore |first14=Antonella |last15=Skaf |first15=Munir S. |last16=Crowley |first16=Michael F. |last17=Thorne |first17=Alan W. |last18=Johnson |first18=Christopher W. |last19=Woodcock |first19=H.

The international community has agreed that reducing pollution in the oceans is a priority, which is tracked as part of Sustainable Development Goal 14 which actively seeks to undo these human impacts on the oceans.United Nations (2017) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017, [[:File:A RES 71 313 E.pdf|Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] ([https://undocs.org/A/RES/71/313 A/RES/71/313]) The title of Target 14.1 is: By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including [[marine debris]] and [[nutrient pollution]].== History == convention on marine pollution (as of April 2008)]]Although marine pollution has a long history, significant international laws to counter it were not enacted until the twentieth century. Marine pollution was a concern during several [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea]] beginning in the 1950s. Most scientists believed that the oceans were so vast that they had unlimited ability to dilute, and thus render pollution harmless.{{cn|date=April 2023}}In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there were several controversies about dumping radioactive waste off the coasts of the United States by companies licensed by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], into the Irish Sea from the British reprocessing facility at [[Windscale]], and into the Mediterranean Sea by the French [[Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique]]. After the Mediterranean Sea controversy, for example, [[Jacques Cousteau]] became a worldwide figure in the campaign to stop marine pollution. Marine pollution made further international headlines after the 1967 crash of the oil tanker [[Torrey Canyon]], and after the 1969 [[Santa Barbara oil spill]] off the coast of California.{{cn|date=April 2023}}Marine pollution was a major area of discussion during the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], held in Stockholm. That year also saw the signing of the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]], sometimes called the [[London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter|London Convention]]. The London Convention did not ban marine pollution, but it established black and gray lists for substances to be banned (black) or regulated by national authorities (gray). Cyanide and high-level radioactive waste, for example, were put on the black list. The London Convention applied only to waste dumped from ships, and thus did nothing to regulate waste discharged as liquids from pipelines.{{cite book|author=Hamblin, Jacob Darwin|title=Poison in the Well: Radioactive Waste in the Oceans at the Dawn of the Nuclear Age|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0813542201}}== Society and culture == causes vast quantities of trash to wash ashore at the south end of Hawaii.]]=== Laws and policies ===There are different ways for the ocean to get polluted, therefore there have been multiple laws, policies, and treaties put into place throughout history. In order to protect the ocean from marine pollution, policies have been developed internationally. In 1948, Harry Truman signed a law formerly known as the [[Clean Water Act|Federal Water Pollution Control Act]]{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=J.

In 1972, the [[Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972]] (MPRSA) was passed by the [[United States Congress]], and regulates ocean dumping of waste in US waters.{{cite web |title=Learn About Ocean Dumping |url=https://www.epa.gov/ocean-dumping/learn-about-ocean-dumping |date=2022-06-08 |publisher=EPA}}{{cite journal |last1=Lang |first1=Gregory E. |date=1990 |title=Plastics, the Marine Menace: Causes and Cures |journal=Journal of Land Use & Environmental Law |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=729-752 |jstor=42842563}} The 1954 Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil and the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships were weakly enforced due to a lack of respect for the laws from flag states.{{Cite journal |last1=Rand |first1=Gary M. |last2=Carriger |first2=John F. |date=2001-01-01 |title=U.S. environmental law statutes in coastal zone protection |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620200111 |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=115-121 |doi=10.1002/etc.5620200111 |pmid=11351397 |s2cid=40130385 |issn=0730-7268}} In 1973 and 1978, [[MARPOL 73/78]] was a treaty written to control vessel pollution, especially regarding oil.
