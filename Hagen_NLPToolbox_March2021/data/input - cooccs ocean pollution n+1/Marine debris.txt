Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of [[gyre]]s and on [[coast]]lines, frequently washing aground, when it is known as ''beach litter'' or tidewrack. Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called ''ocean dumping''. Naturally occurring debris, such as [[driftwood]] and [[drift seed]]s, are also present. With the increasing use of [[plastic]], human influence has become an issue as many types of (petrochemical) plastics do not [[Biodegradation|biodegrade]] quickly<!-- How long? -->, as would natural or organic materials.{{Cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/living/2019/07/10/watch-italy-s-answer-to-the-problem-with-plastic|title=Euronews Living &#124; Watch: Italy's answer to the problem with plastic|first=Rachel|last=Graham|date=10 July 2019|website=living}} The largest single type of plastic pollution (~10%) and majority of large plastic in the oceans is discarded and [[Ghost net|lost nets]] from the fishing industry.{{Cite web|date=2019-11-06|title=Dumped fishing gear is biggest plastic polluter in ocean, finds report|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/06/dumped-fishing-gear-is-biggest-plastic-polluter-in-ocean-finds-report|access-date=2021-04-09|website=The Guardian|language=en}} Waterborne plastic poses a serious threat to [[fish]], [[seabird]]s, [[marine reptile]]s, and [[marine mammal]]s, as well as to boats and coasts.{{cite web|url=http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/marinedebris101|title=Facts about marine debris|publisher=US NOAA|access-date=10 April 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213110801/http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/marinedebris101/|archive-date=13 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}Dumping, container spillages, litter washed into [[storm drain]]s and [[waterway]]s and wind-blown [[landfill]] waste all contribute to this problem. This increased [[water pollution]] has caused serious negative effects such as discarded fishing nets capturing animals, concentration of plastic debris in massive [[marine garbage patch]]es, and increasing concentrations of contaminants in the [[food chain]].In efforts to prevent and mediate marine debris and pollutants, laws and policies have been adopted internationally, with the UN including reduced [[marine pollution]] in [[Sustainable Development Goal 14]] Life Below Water. Depending on relevance to the issues and various levels of contribution, some countries have introduced more specified protection policies. Moreover, some non-profits, NGOs, and government organizations are developing programs to collect and remove plastics from the ocean. However, in 2017 the UN estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans if substantial measures are not taken.{{Cite web|date=2017-04-27|title=FEATURE: UN's mission to keep plastics out of oceans and marine life|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/04/556132-feature-uns-mission-keep-plastics-out-oceans-and-marine-life|access-date=2020-12-08|website=UN News|language=en}}{{Toclimit|3}}== Types ==, Tanzania]] over one month]]Researchers classify debris as either land- or ocean-based; in 1991, the [[United Nations]] Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution estimated that up to 80% of the pollution was land-based,{{Cite journal | last1 = Sheavly | first1 = S.

The activities can include fishing, boating, and aquaculture industries that harvest or use resources in the marine environment and may lose or discard gear, materials, machinery or solid wastes from industrial processes into the water or onto shorelines. This can include anything as large as a fishing boat or as small as particle from a [[Styrofoam]] lobster float. In 2003, a study was conducted to identify types, amounts, sources, and effects of persistent industrial marine debris in the coastal waters and along the shores of [[Charlotte County, New Brunswick]], and examine any relationship between the amount and types of persistent industrial marine debris, and the types and numbers of industrial operations nearby.{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Christine |title=Persistent Industrial Marine Debris: The Relationship Between Marine Debris and Coastal Industrial Activity in Charlotte County New Brunswick |url=https://central.bac-lac.gc.ca/.item?id=MQ79594&op=pdf&app=Library&oclc_number=56632868 |access-date=22 March 2023}} Materials like plastic or foam can break down into smaller particles and may look like small sea creatures to wildlife such as birds, cetaceans, and fish, and they may eat these particles.

(2018). Human footprint in the abyss: 30 year records of deep-sea plastic debris. ''Marine Policy'', ''96'', 204-212. Studies that have been done have conducted research through bottom sampling, video observation via remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and submersibles. They are also mostly limited to one-off projects that do not extend long enough to show significant effects of deep-sea debris over time. Research thus far has shown that debris in the deep-ocean is in fact impacted by anthropogenic activities, and plastic has been frequently observed in the deep-sea, especially in areas off-shore of heavily populated regions, such as the Mediterranean.Litter, made from diverse materials that are denser than surface water (such as [[glass]]es, metals and some plastics), have been found to spread over the floor of seas and open oceans, where it can become entangled in [[coral]]s and interfere with other [[Benthos|sea-floor life]], or even become buried under sediment, making [[Marine salvage|clean-up]] extremely difficult, especially due to the wide area of its dispersal compared to [[shipwrecks]].{{Cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=Alexa J.|last2=Walker|first2=Tony R.|last3=Brown|first3=Craig J.|last4=Wilson|first4=Brittany R.|last5=Gazzola|first5=Vicki|last6=Sameoto|first6=Jessica A.|date=2020-01-01|title=Benthic marine debris in the Bay of Fundy, eastern Canada: Spatial distribution and categorization using seafloor video footage|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|language=en|volume=150|pages=110722|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110722|pmid=31733907|bibcode=2020MarPB.15010722G |doi-access=free}} Plastics that are usually negatively buoyant can sink with the adherence of phytoplankton and the aggregation of other organic particles. Other oceanic processes that affect circulation, such as coastal storms and offshore convection, play a part in transferring large volumes of particles and debris. Submarine topographic features can also augment downwelling currents, leading to the retention of [[microplastics]] at certain locations.Woodall, L. C., Sanchez-Vidal, A., Canals, M., Paterson, G.

The two most significant types of debris were macro-plastic, making up 33% of the debris found - 89% of which was single-use - and metal, making up 26%. Plastic debris was even found at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, at a depth of 10,898m, and plastic bags were found entangled in hydrothermal vent and cold seep communities.=== Garbage patches (gyres) ==={{excerpt|Garbage patch|paragraphs=1|file=no}}==Sources==]]The 10 largest emitters of oceanic plastic pollution worldwide are, from the most to the least, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh,{{cite journal |last1=Jambeck |first1=Jenna R. |last2=Geyer |first2=Roland |last3=Wilcox |first3=Chris |title=Plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean |journal=Science |date=12 February 2015 |volume=347 |issue=6223 |pages=768-771 |url=https://www.iswa.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Calendar_2011_03_AMERICANA/Science-2015-Jambeck-768-71__2_.pdf |access-date=28 August 2018 |bibcode=2015Sci...347..768J |doi=10.1126/science.1260352 |pmid=25678662 |s2cid=206562155 |archive-date=22 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122073818/https://www.iswa.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Calendar_2011_03_AMERICANA/Science-2015-Jambeck-768-71__2_.pdf |url-status=dead }} largely through the rivers Yangtze, Indus, Yellow, Hai, Nile, Ganges, Pearl, Amur, Niger, and the Mekong, and accounting for 90 percent of all the plastic that reaches the world's oceans.{{cite journal |last1=Christian Schmidt |last2=Tobias Krauth |last3=Stephan Wagner |title=Export of Plastic Debris by Rivers into the Sea |journal=[[Environmental Science & Technology]] |date=11 October 2017 |volume=51 |issue=21 |pages=12246-12253 |doi=10.1021/acs.est.7b02368 |pmid=29019247 |quote=The 10 top-ranked rivers transport 88-95% of the global load into the sea|bibcode=2017EnST...5112246S |url=http://oceanrep.geomar.de/43169/4/es7b02368_si_001.pdf }}{{cite news |last1=Harald Franzen |title=Almost all plastic in the ocean comes from just 10 rivers |url=https://p.dw.com/p/2oTF6 |access-date=18 December 2018 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=30 November 2017 |quote=It turns out that about 90 percent of all the plastic that reaches the world's oceans gets flushed through just 10 rivers: The Yangtze, the Indus, Yellow River, Hai River, the Nile, the Ganges, Pearl River, Amur River, the Niger, and the Mekong (in that order).}}An estimated 10,000 [[Containerization|containers]] at sea each year are lost by [[container ship]]s, usually during storms.{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/06/0619_seacargo.html |title=Lost Sea Cargo: Beach Bounty or Junk? |access-date=8 April 2008 |date=19 June 2001 |author=Janice Podsada |publisher=National Geographic News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406043240/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/06/0619_seacargo.html |archive-date=6 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }} One spillage occurred in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1992, when thousands of [[Friendly Floatees|rubber ducks and other toys]] (now known as the Friendly Floatees) went overboard during a storm.
