Implementation of regular annual reporting and evaluation of production and waste generation processes to enhance effective management strategies. Advocacy for the adoption of sustainable business practices in the realm of plastic utilization. Encouragement of innovative design approaches and inventive solutions for plastic-based products and packaging.==How it works==PDP asks businesses to measure, manage, reduce and benefit from plastic waste to create a world where plastic benefits consumers and businesses without negatively impacting the environment. PDP is based on the principle that to effectively manage and improve efficiency in plastic use, reuse and [[plastic recycling|recycling]], businesses must first quantify their plastics.{{cite web |url=http://www.plasticdisclosure.org/about/how-it-works.html |title= How PDP works}} Annual disclosure requests are sent to companies that use plastic for goods and/or services on behalf of socially conscious investors and community stakeholders.PDP aims to connect solution providers with prospective companies to facilitate design and innovation.{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticdisclosure.org/solutions.html |title= Plastic Solutions}} All types of organizations are invited to participate in PDP and commit to reducing their plastic footprint.==Company disclosures==The Plastic Disclosure Project (PDP) is an initiative that aims to track and reduce plastic waste generated by companies and institutions. [[Lush (company)]] was the first participant to disclose its plastic waste data in 2011, followed by [[University of California, Berkeley Campus Architecture|UC Berkeley]], the first university to join in 2012.{{cite web |url=http://www.hamiltonadvisorsltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LUSH-disclosure-Plastic_Disclosure_Project_kate-2.pdf |title= Plastic Disclosure Project: Lush Cosmetics}}{{cite web |url=https://www.lush.co.uk/content/view/5205 |title=Lush are the first company to disclose its plastic usage! |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216035420/https://www.lush.co.uk/content/view/5205 |archivedate=2013-02-16 }} {{cite web|url=http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/06/07/plastic-disclosure-project/ |title= UC Berkeley joins the PDP|date= 7 June 2012}} The project is managed by Campus Recycling and Refuse Services, along with the Office of Sustainability, with plans to assign interns to monitor plastic waste leaving the campus. Interest in this project has been expressed by companies from various countries.During the [[Plasticity Forum]] Rio '12, an alliance was formed between [[Plastic Pollution Coalition]] and PDP to collaborate on reducing plastic waste in university campuses worldwide.{{cite web |url=http://www.packagingeurope.com/Packaging-Europe-News/48485/Plasticity-Rio-Showcases-Solutions-Innovations-and-Opportunities-in-the-Plastic-Industry.html |title=Plasticity Rio showcases solutions, innovations and opportunities in the plastic industry |access-date=2012-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501194302/http://packagingeurope.com/Packaging-Europe-News/48485/Plasticity-Rio-Showcases-Solutions-Innovations-and-Opportunities-in-the-Plastic-Industry.html |archive-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead }}Dallas-based environmental consultancy, Earth People, is the first consulting firm to provide plastic assessment and reporting services through PDP for its clients.{{cite web |url=http://www.earthpeopleco.com/ |title=Home |website=earthpeopleco.com}} {{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/1/prweb9070829.htm |title= EarthPeople becomes first sustainability consultancy in the U.S. to endorse plastic disclosure project |work=PRWeb |date= January 3, 2012}}==References=={{Reflist}}==External links== [http://www.plasticdisclosure.org Plastic Disclosure Project] [http://www.oceanrecov.org Ocean Recovery Alliance]{{Authority control}}}]}}
