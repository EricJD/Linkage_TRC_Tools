Polymers such as [[polyethylene]](PE), [[polypropylene]] (PP), and [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) are incredibly useful for their durability and relatively low cost of production, however it is their persistence and difficulty to be properly disposed of that is leading to pollution of the environment and disruption of natural processes. It is estimated that each year there are 9-14 million metric tons of plastic that are entering the ocean due to inefficient solutions for their disposal.{{Cite journal |last1=Zrimec |first1=Jan |last2=Kokina |first2=Mariia |last3=Jonasson |first3=Sara |last4=Zorrilla |first4=Francisco |last5=Zelezniak |first5=Aleksej |date=2021-10-26 |title=Plastic-Degrading Potential across the Global Microbiome Correlates with Recent Pollution Trends |journal=mBio |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=e0215521 |doi=10.1128/mbio.02155-21 |issn=2150-7511 |pmc=8546865 |pmid=34700384}} The biochemical pathways that allow for certain microbes to break down these polymers into less harmful byproducts has been a topic of study to develop a suitable anti-pollutant.== Adaptive pressures ==With the increasing presence of plastics in the environment, certain species of bacteria have evolved to degrade plastics into harmless by-products. Over the last 70 years, microbes have evolved to degrade plastics, as the global production of plastics steadily increased from 2 million metric tons to 380 million metric tons per year.{{Cite journal |last=Geyer |first=Roland |date=19 Jul 2017 |title=Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made |journal=Science Advances |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=7 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1700782 |pmid=28776036 |pmc=5517107 |bibcode=2017SciA....3E0782G }} A study performed in 2021, led by Jan Zrimec of National Institute of Biology, Slovenia, was able to isolate 30,000 non-redundant enzyme homologues from more than 200 million genes in DNA samples obtained from the environment capable of degrading 10 different types of plastics.The results have showcased the impact of plastic pollution on the microbial environment and the tendency to adapt to a rapidly changing situation. A strong correlation can be seen between the microbial potential to degrade plastics and the content of global plastic pollution. Of the 30,000 enzyme homologues isolated, 12,000 were found in samples from the ocean. Region specific analyses show that plastic degrading enzymes were found in high concentrations in deeper areas of the ocean where [[plastic pollution]] was more common.== Metabolism ===== Diversity ===With over 5000 grades of plastic polymers and variations in coatings such as flame retardants and pigments, diverse plastic polymer substrates suggest the existence of very heterogenous metabolic processes in plastic degradation.{{Cite journal |last1=Jacquin |first1=Justine |last2=Cheng |first2=Jingguang |last3=Odobel |first3=Charlène |last4=Pandin |first4=Caroline |last5=Conan |first5=Pascal |last6=Pujo-Pay |first6=Mireille |last7=Barbe |first7=Valérie |last8=Meistertzheim |first8=Anne-Leila |last9=Ghiglione |first9=Jean-Franu00e7ois |date=2019 |title=Microbial Ecotoxicology of Marine Plastic Debris: A Review on Colonization and Biodegradation by the Plastisphere |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology |volume=10 |page=865 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2019.00865 |pmid=31073297 |pmc=6497127 |issn=1664-302X|doi-access=free }} Dynamic ocean conditions ranging in humidity, temperature, UV irradiation, pH, wind, and waves,{{Cite journal |last1=Oliveira |first1=Juliana |last2=Belchior |first2=Afonso |last3=da Silva |first3=Veru00f4nica D. |last4=Rotter |first4=Ana |last5=Petrovski |first5=u017deljko |last6=Almeida |first6=Pedro L. |last7=Lourenu00e7o |first7=Nu00eddia D. |last8=Gaudu00eancio |first8=Susana P. |date=2020 |title=Marine Environmental Plastic Pollution: Mitigation by Microorganism Degradation and Recycling Valorization |journal=Frontiers in Marine Science |volume=7 |doi=10.3389/fmars.2020.567126 |issn=2296-7745|doi-access=free }} create varied growth conditions for bacteria and increase the possibility of diversified plastic degradation metabolisms.=== Mechanisms ===As a developing topic, few studies have characterized the metabolic and biochemical mechanisms involved in the degradation of plastic by marine microbes.{{Cite journal |last1=Singh |first1=Baljit |last2=Sharma |first2=Nisha |date=2008-03-01 |title=Mechanistic implications of plastic degradation |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391007003539 |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |language=en |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=561-584 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2007.11.008 |issn=0141-3910}}{{Cite journal |last1=Kolvenbach |first1=Boris A |last2=Helbling |first2=Damian E |last3=Kohler |first3=Hans-Peter E |last4=Corvini |first4=Philippe F-X |date=2014-06-01 |title=Emerging chemicals and the evolution of biodegradation capacities and pathways in bacteria |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166913006411 |journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology |series=Energy biotechnology u2022 Environmental biotechnology |language=en |volume=27 |pages=8-14 |doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2013.08.017 |pmid=24863891 |issn=0958-1669}} A limited number of plastic degradation pathways in marine microbes have been extensively studied. It is important to note that although several metabolic processes in plastic degradation have been well-documented, these processes are likely not representative of the microbial population capable of plastic degradation.

Since the discovery of bacteria that can feed on plastic, there has been hope that these microbes could help clean the ocean of plastic, but Ramani Narayan, a professor in chemical engineering at Michigan State University says that this viewpoint misses the point.{{Cite web |title=Plastic-eating Microbes Won't Solve Our Ocean Debris Problem |url=https://www.capeandislands.org/show/living-lab-radio-on-cai/2018-04-23/plastic-eating-microbes-wont-solve-our-ocean-debris-problem |access-date=2022-04-08 |website=CAI |language=en}} Moreover, after Kale et al. performed an extensive review of all data available on these bacteria, they have found that there are currently no practical industrial applications of these microbes in environments to make a substantial impact on the plastic problem in the ocean.{{cite journal |last1=Kale |first1=Swapnil |last2=Deshmukh |first2=Amit |last3=Dudhare |first3=Mahendra |last4=Patil |first4=Vikram |title=Microbial degradation of plastic: a review |journal=J Biochem Tech |date=4 Nov 2015 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=952-961}} This can be attributed to findings that have found the rate of degradation by these microbes to be low, even when optimized in laboratory settings.{{cite journal |last1=Krueger |first1=Martin |last2=Harms |first2=Hauke |last3=Schlosser |first3=Dietmar |title=Prospects for microbiological solutions to environmental pollution with plastics |journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |date=Nov 2015 |volume=99 |issue=21 |pages=8857-74 |doi=10.1007/s00253-015-6879-4 |pmid=26318446 |s2cid=8797245 |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26318446/}} Hence, researchers at the University of Portsmouth have been working on genetically engineering these bacteria to be more efficient at degrading the plastic{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}}.=== Genetic engineering ===Scientists are working on genetically engineering ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]]'' to break down PET plastic at a faster rate in order to make it a viable option to help recycle plastic.{{Cite web |last=Carpenter |first=Scott |title=The Race To Develop Plastic-Eating Bacteria |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/03/10/the-race-to-develop-plastic-eating-bacteria/ |access-date=2022-04-08 |website=Forbes |language=en}} Researchers at the University of Portsmouth have discovered that mixing PETase with a second enzyme called MHETase has created an u201cenzyme cocktailu201d that degrades PET plastic at 6 times the rate it did before.{{cite web |title=New Enzyme Cocktail Digests Plastic Waste Six Times Faster |url=https://www.port.ac.uk/news-events-and-blogs/news/new-enzyme-cocktail-digests-plastic-waste-six-times-faster. |website=University of Portsmouth News |publisher=University of Portsmouth |access-date=30 March 2022}}{{cite journal |last1=Knott |first1=Brandon |last2=Erickson |first2=Erika |last3=Allen |first3=Mark |last4=Gado |first4=Japheth |last5=Graham |first5=Rosie |last6=Kearns |first6=Fiona |last7=Pardo |first7=Isabel |last8=Topuzlu |first8=Ece |last9=Anderson |first9=Jared |last10=Austin |first10=Harry |last11=Dominick |first11=Graham |last12=Johnson |first12=Christopher |last13=Rorrer |first13=Nicholas |last14=Szostkiewicz |first14=Caralyn |last15=Copie |first15=Valerie |last16=Payne |first16=Christina |last17=Woodcock |first17=H Lee |last18=Donohoe |first18=Bryon |last19=Beckham |first19=Gregg |last20=McGeehan |first20=John |title=Characterization and Engineering of a Two-Enzyme System for Plastics Depolymerization |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2020 |volume=117 |issue=41 |pages=25476-25485 |doi=10.1073/pnas.2006753117 |pmid=32989159 |pmc=7568301 |bibcode=2020PNAS..11725476K |doi-access=free }} In an interview done by Bloomberg QuickTake, Professor John McGeehan, who worked with the team at the University of Portsmouth to make this discovery, spoke of the possibility to create an enzyme powder that could be distributed across [[plastic recycling]] facilities to break down plastics to their constituent components, [[Ethylene glycol|Ethylene Glycol]] and [[Terephthalic acid|Terephthalic Acid]].{{cite web |last1=Tom |first1=Gibson |title=Could Plastic-Eating Bacteria Save The Planet? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDhPuyrSq3E&t=207s&ab_channel=BloombergQuicktake |website=YouTube |publisher=Bloomberg Quicktake |access-date=17 Mar 2022}} These building blocks could then be used to make new plastics, which would create a more efficient and effective way of recycling plastics. However, Dr. Hermann J. Heipieper from the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research does not see this as a viable option due to the high bond strength found in plastic.Another major part of the research being done on microbial environmental remediation involves manipulating the genomes of specific microbes to increase their metabolic power. For example, in ''Pseudomonas putida'', scientists have engineered a strain to overexpress ''glc'' and ''glcDEF'', operons that contain genes coding for enzymes that convert toxic intermediates into the next substrates in the pathway. This would allow plastic monomers such as ethylene glycol to be converted into high-value chemicals such as medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA). As a natural bioplastic, PHAs have similar properties to synthetic plastics and are biodegradable as well as nontoxic making them useful for biomedical applications. Its utility even extends to its potential for the production of hydrocarbon jet fuel if further chemically catalyzed.{{Cite journal |last1=Franden |first1=Mary Ann |last2=Jayakody |first2=Lahiru N. |last3=Li |first3=Wing-Jin |last4=Wagner |first4=Neil J. |last5=Cleveland |first5=Nicholas S. |last6=Michener |first6=William E. |last7=Hauer |first7=Bernhard |last8=Blank |first8=Lars M. |last9=Wierckx |first9=Nick |last10=Klebensberger |first10=Janosch |last11=Beckham |first11=Gregg T. |date=July 2018 |title=Engineering Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for efficient ethylene glycol utilization |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1096717617304731 |journal=Metabolic Engineering |language=en |volume=48 |pages=197-207 |doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2018.06.003|pmid=29885475 |s2cid=47010584 |doi-access=free }}Genetically engineered bacteria also do not have a practical application in the ocean, yet, according to the Ocean Conservatory group.{{Cite web |date=2018-04-19 |title=Mutant Enzymes are Cool, But Not Likely to Solve Our Ocean Plastics Problem |url=https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2018/04/19/mutant-enzymes-cool-not-likely-solve-ocean-plastics-problem/ |access-date=2022-04-09 |website=Ocean Conservancy |language=en}} Dr. Naryan believes that releasing genetically engineered bacteria into the ocean ecosystems could be irresponsible and have many negative side effects on the ecosystem. As the Ocean Conservatory group states, the solution to the plastic problem does not lie in genetically engineered bacteria, but rather decreasing the plastic input into the ocean and increasing collection and recycling efforts.With these potential limitations in mind, a deeper comparison of the pros and cons of engineering microbes for plastic degradation should be conducted. As mentioned, one problem in environmental remediation of plastics is that only 30% of plastics are collected to be recycled.{{Cite journal |last1=Kaushal |first1=Jyoti |last2=Khatri |first2=Madhu |last3=Arya |first3=Shailendra Kumar |date=June 2021 |title=Recent insight into enzymatic degradation of plastics prevalent in the environment: A mini - review |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2666790821000434 |journal=Cleaner Engineering and Technology |language=en |volume=2 |pages=100083 |doi=10.1016/j.clet.2021.100083|s2cid=233543111 |doi-access=free }} Without efficient collection in the first place, the high energy cost of enzymatic recycling would be more burdening than the amount of waste it would break down. Another problem includes the fact that this may not be applicable at a wide scale since enzymes have a short half-life so engineered organisms may not remain catalytically active for long enough to be effective. On the other hand, to fix unpredictable enzyme-polymer interactions, there has been development of new techniques such as computational tools to visualize the 3-D interactions between plastics and enzymes.{{Cite journal |last1=Qi |first1=Xinhua |last2=Yan |first2=Wenlong |last3=Cao |first3=Zhibei |last4=Ding |first4=Mingzhu |last5=Yuan |first5=Yingjin |date=2021-12-26 |title=Current Advances in the Biodegradation and Bioconversion of Polyethylene Terephthalate |journal=Microorganisms |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=39 |doi=10.3390/microorganisms10010039 |pmid=35056486 |pmc=8779501 |issn=2076-2607 |doi-access=free }} Thus, engineered microbes can remain as a hopeful solution for plastic remediation.=== Toxicity of degradation products ===A study was performed to understand the toxicity of the degradation of polythene bags and cups by ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa|P. aeruginosa]], [[Streptomyces|Streptomyces sp]]., [[Aspergillus niger]], [[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and ''Rhizopus sp.{{Cite journal |last1=Venkatesh |first1=S. |last2=Mahboob |first2=Shahid |last3=Govindarajan |first3=Marimuthu |last4=Al-Ghanim |first4=Khalid A. |last5=Ahmed |first5=Zubair |last6=Al-Mulhm |first6=Norah |last7=Gayathri |first7=R. |last8=Vijayalakshmi |first8=S. |date=2021-05-01 |title=Microbial degradation of plastics: Sustainable approach to tackling environmental threats facing big cities of the future |journal=Journal of King Saud University - Science |language=en |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=101362 |doi=10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101362 |issn=1018-3647 |s2cid=233548902|doi-access=free }}'' The study found carbon dioxide gas to be the main byproduct of the degradation process of polythene by the bacteria mentioned before. However, the particles produced as a byproduct of PE bio-degradation had negative impacts on the production of polysaccharides, proteins, and nutrient uptake in roots of plants. Another study performed by Aswale focused on how biodegraded polythene affected seed germination in plants. It found that biodegraded polythene was correlated with a decrease in percentage of seed germination, indicating that the byproducts of the breakdown could have negative effects on the seed health.{{Cite thesis |last=Aswale |first=Pranita Nandkumar |date=29 Jan 2011 |title=Studies on biodegradation of polythene |type=PhD thesis |publisher=Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University |url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/handle/10603/78820 |hdl=10603/78820 }}=== Food web biomagnification ===As seen in Figure 4, food web biomagnification refers to the process by which concentrations of contaminants increase as the trophic levels increase.{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Robert |title=Biomagnification |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/biomagnification#:~:text=Biomagnification%20is%20the%20accumulation%20of,greater%20than%20expected%20from%20equilibrium |website=ScienceDirect |access-date=28 March 2022}} In terms of plastic, this means when plankton eat plastic, then fish eat the plankton, and larger fish eat that fish, the amount of plastic accumulates in the largest fish. Therefore, removing plastic from the system at the bacteria level would prevent the plastic from bioaccumulating in larger fish. However, as mentioned above, these bacteria are not very efficient at degrading plastic, and therefore do not have the capabilities to create a substantial impact on this problem.{{clear}}== References =={{Reflist}}}]}}
