It was also a location where those who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.{{cite news|url=http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7334574|title=Big Island Beach Attracts Plastic Trash|last=Dashefsky|first=Howard|date=9 November 2007|work=KHNL NBC 8 Honolulu Hawaii|accessdate=2008-12-05|publisher=[[KHNL]]}}{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,2177579,full.story|title=Plague of Plastic Chokes the Seas|last=Weiss|first=Kenneth R.|date=2006-08-02|work=Part 4: Altered Oceans|accessdate=2013-02-16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210215429/http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-ocean2aug02%2C0%2C2177579%2Cfull.story|archive-date=2012-12-10|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}} ==Description==Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the remote southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u016b District]] on the island of Hawaii, at coordinates {{coord |18|58|13|N|155|35|59|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| display=inline,title}}. There are no paved roads to the beach.This beach, situated on a lower lava terrace, is a storm beach. It was formed by the deposit of large amounts of sand blown by prevailing winds.At the point of Kamilo, waves have cut a large indentation, creating a variety of rocky points, ponds, and channels. Most of these are exposed during low tides, and are awash during high tides.The backshore at Kamilo contains such vegetation as [[Scaevola (plant)|naupaka]], [[Thespesia populnea|milo]], and [[Casuarina equisetifolia|ironwood]].==Debris==The beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade wind]]s and converging [[ocean current]]s.{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/10/kamilo-beach-plastic-hawaii-pollution|title=Welcome to Hawaii's 'plastic beach': ground zero of a pollution crisis|last=Barney|first=Liz|date=2020-01-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}} The debris is situated on the narrow, crescent-shaped strip of white sand, formed along the inland border of this area.The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5&nbsp;km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.{{cite serial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079st6 |network=[[BBC Two]] |title=Natural World |episode=Message in the Waves - Hawai'i}} Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority by weight are [[fishing]] related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap [[hagfish]], spacers used in [[oyster farming]], [[buoy]]s, crates, and baskets. Much of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production [[Plastic particle water pollution|nurdle]]s or pellets created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces.In 2020, Hawaii's Department of Health listed the beach as impaired based on [[plastic pollution]], which is the first time that any Hawaiian waters.{{cite web |last1=Honore |first1=Marcel |title=EPA Forces State Health Officials To Address Plastic Pollution On Hawaii Beaches |url=https://www.civilbeat.org/beat/epa-forces-state-health-officials-to-address-plastic-pollution-on-hawaii-beaches/?ct=t(RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN) |website=Honolulu Civil Beat |accessdate=21 July 2020 |date=July 17, 2020}}==Environmental impact==[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage.

Others absorb [[toxin]]s such as [[DDT]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.{{cite news   | last = McNarie   | first = Alan D.   | title = Sea of plastic   | work = [[Honolulu Weekly]]   | date = 5 December 2007   | url = http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/   | accessdate = 2008-12-06   | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150212013519/http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/   | archive-date = 12 February 2015   | url-status = dead   }}==Cleanup efforts==Multiple community-based cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to these efforts, the debris was {{convert|8|to|10|ft|m}} high in some places.  Most of the efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have been led by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and their countless [[beach cleanup]] volunteers, however other groups, including Imi Pono No Ka 'Aina, Hawaii Rainbow Gatherings, CITO geocachers, Sierra Club Hawaii and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i have also helped coordinate occasional events.  In 2003, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 100 volunteers and removed over 50 tons (45 metric tonnes) of fishing nets and other marine debris from the beach. {{cite web|url=http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup|title=Hawaii Wildlife Fund - South Point Beach Cleanup 2/06|last=Lawrence|first=Charles|year=2006|work=Photo gallery|publisher=PBase.com|accessdate=2008-12-06}}  See also: {{cite news|url=http://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/articles/2006/02/24/local_news/local01.txt|title=Try running your toes through this|last=Smith|first=Dave|date=2006-02-24|publisher=[[Hawaii Tribune-Herald]]}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}In November 2007, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i volunteers removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from Kamilo Beach.==See also== [[List of beaches in Hawaii (island)]] [[Marine debris]] [[Marine pollution]]==References==}
